But most often people would turn and look at him and say, ‘What is it?’\r\n\r\nIt was abstract. He’d say it firmly, and people not into art would nod sagely as if they knew, and people into art would nod sagely because they knew. Abstract is a genius artist, someone that persuades you stump up hard cash and do all the work in figuring it out.\r\n\r\nCouldn’t say that back to people.\r\n\r\nBut she loved it, and that was the main thing.

He could barely stand the heat coming off the hearth but she seemed not to care, and she seemed not to notice until he put his arms on her shoulders and pulled her away.\r\n\r\nGlazed eyes looked back for a moment until she focussed. It was a breathy voice that spoke to him.\r\n\r\n‘I could see it. I could see the waters of the lake, and they were calling to me. Dive in, dive! And so I dove, deeper and deeper, and then I couldn’t breathe, and then…’\r\n\r\nAnd then she kissed him. And then she took him upstairs.\r\n\r\nAnd then it was different. There was something different about it, something he couldn’t quite put his finger on despite how hard he tried.\r\n\r\nWhen he showed the picture to his mother she stared hard for a long time as well. She turned her hard stare on both of them, and then sat on the sofa, knees pressed together, tartan handbag on top as a shield.\r\n\r\nIt was the most disgusting thing she’d ever seen.\r\n\r\n‘But…it’s abstract! It’s mountains and a lake, with little trees around.’\r\n\r\nAnd his mother said, ‘It’s a woman on her back. Those mountains are her legs, and she’s showing you her business.’\r\n\r\nAnd for the first time he looked, he really looked.\r\n\r\nAnd then he looked at his wife. Who was sat down with her knees pressed firmly together, one hand over her mouth. \r\n\r\n","errors":[],"path":"her/booyah/4","html":"<p>‘I love it.’</p>\n<p>‘I hate it.’</p>\n<p>‘Well I love it.’</p>\n<p>‘And I hate it.’</p>\n<p>It was two triangles without bases, and in between at the bottom was a small diamond ringed by small clouds.
