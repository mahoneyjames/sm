<p>‘I hate it.’</p>
<p>‘Well I love it.’</p>
<p>‘And I hate it.’</p>
<p>It was two triangles without bases, and in between at the bottom was a small diamond ringed by small clouds. It was called “Mountains and lake”, done in freehand charcoal and nothing else. Of course they were going to buy it; she only had to turn those eyes on him and he was putty, but he liked the journey. He knew without asking it was going over the fireplace but he asked anyway, wanting to see her pout.</p>
<p>It was a talking point, this plain white canvas five foot by four with nothing on it but black lines, and nothing to frame it because the artist – Beverley – said that frames were cages and art should be free to soar.</p>
<p>People said it was striking, or it was interesting.  But most often people would turn and look at him and say, ‘What is it?’</p>
<p>It was abstract. He’d say it firmly, and people not into art would nod sagely as if they knew, and people into art would nod sagely because they knew. Abstract is a genius artist, someone that persuades you stump up hard cash and do all the work in figuring it out.</p>
<p>Couldn’t say that back to people.</p>
<p>But she loved it, and that was the main thing. He’d come home and find her stood in front of it. One time she had her arms folded on the shelf above the hearth, leaning so close she could have reached out with her tongue and licked it. He could barely stand the heat coming off the hearth but she seemed not to care, and she seemed not to notice until he put his arms on her shoulders and pulled her away.</p>
<p>Glazed eyes looked back for a moment until she focussed. It was a breathy voice that spoke to him.</p>
<p>‘I could see it. I could see the waters of the lake, and they were calling to me. Dive in, dive! And so I dove, deeper and deeper, and then I couldn’t breathe, and then…’</p>
<p>And then she kissed him. And then she took him upstairs.</p>
<p>And then it was different. There was something different about it, something he couldn’t quite put his finger on despite how hard he tried.</p>
<p>When he showed the picture to his mother she stared hard for a long time as well. She turned her hard stare on both of them, and then sat on the sofa, knees pressed together, tartan handbag on top as a shield.</p>
<p>It was the most disgusting thing she’d ever seen.</p>
<p>‘But…it’s abstract! It’s mountains and a lake, with little trees around.’</p>
<p>And his mother said, ‘It’s a woman on her back. Those mountains are her legs, and she’s showing you her business.’</p>
<p>And for the first time he looked, he really looked.</p>
<p>And then he looked at his wife. Who was sat down with her knees pressed firmly together, one hand over her mouth. </p>

<p>Nobody noticed them at first, of course. Who notices if a homeless guy is there one minute and then not the next? But one day the guy with the long dreadlocks and the dog wasn’t where he usually sat, and, the day after, the lady in the ragged trousers wasn’t dancing along to the high street buskers anymore and people started to wonder to each other on their walks to work where they had gone.</p>
<p>It was a lot more obvious to Joe. He saw them around, got to know one or two of them. Spent a few evenings sharing fags and chips round a bin on fire. It had taken a bit of getting used to, but for the most part the city’s homeless had been pretty accepting of Joe, as a newby.</p>
<p>When Patrick, the guy with the dreads, wasn’t around anymore, that’s when Joe started to worry. Patrick was alright. He’d shown Joe some good places to sleep when it rained and had become a sort of fixture in his little routine. They’d sit together and share a coffee most mornings and Patrick would scratch the ears of his mud-brown shaggy dog and tell Joe stories. Joe would listen, scarcely believing a word, but enjoying the rare companionship.</p>
<p>It had been Patrick who’d told Joe about the bridge. Tucked away in a run-down part of town in an industrial estate, the bridge seemed to draw the city’s down and outs to it like moths. It was sheltered from the wind and rain, an ideal place to sleep, to use, to talk, if talking was what you wanted, to keep a fire going. In fact, the last time Joe had seen Patrick he’d invited him along to the bridge, but he told him no that time, couldn’t remember why now, but he’d had some reason he was sure.</p>
<p>Tonight it was raining hard. Patrick had been playing on Joe’s mind a lot and before he really realised what was happening, Joe had made his way to the bridge. For the first time Joe had been there it was completely abandoned. The grey, crumbling buildings dribbled sludgy runoff into the brown waters that gurgled noisily under the bridge. Far away a street light glowed a surreal orange, bathing the scene in a weird, ethereal light. Joe wiped the rain from his drenched forehead and looked around him. The whole place stank of rot and something long dead.</p>
<p>Too tired to wonder much about the abandonment of the place Joe trudged on forward, not noticing the limp, mud-brown pile of shaggy fur oozing rainwater and something darker onto the uneven, cracked road, or the many single abandoned boots that lay ripped and scattered about the place, or the piles of gleaming white bones, picked clean and lying in neat piles here and there...</p>
<p>As he wandered under the bridge the gurgling noise became a low, dark, rumbling laugh and Joe disappeared into the shadow of the troll’s lair.</p>

<p>The girls stood in the kitchen, near the water-cooler in what looked like urgent discussion. Every day Steve watched them: their rapid hand gestures, the way their eyes lit up or glistened with tears in alternate distress, glee, shock or some mysterious, feminine combination of them all. </p>
<p>Claire covered her mouth with her hands while Jessica’s lips moved almost silently, their eyes not breaking contact for a moment. Steve thought she looked upset.</p>
<p>He took his time rinsing out his cup, drying it meticulously with a paper towel, refilling it with the instant coffee, hot water, milk, his eyes and ears snatching at them as they spoke. To Steve, Jessica was beautiful and he’d been waiting for a chance to talk to her but he never knew where to start. He just felt like a bumbling fool.</p>
<p>This time though, he’d gotten lucky. Jessica might have thought she’d been silent, but Steve had caught the fractured ends of her sentences and they had given him an idea. If he could pull this off Jessica might actually, even if just for a second, become aware of his existence.</p>
<p>After work Steve drove to Nico’s house. Nico had a beautiful cottage with a rickety old chimney teetering picturesquely into the night sky. Smoke gushed out in grey-blue spirals and light spilled generously from the windows. He didn’t stay long, but when he emerged he was holding a small cardboard box, which snuffled endearingly. </p>
<p>He’d driven Jessica home after a works dinner once, so he knew where she lived. He hoped it wasn’t creepy, just appearing on her doorstep like that, but his judgement told him it was right: Jessica was upset, his gift would make her feel better and he’d be Steve the Hero. For a while at least. </p>
<p>He got out of the car. It was bin night and he edged past Jessica’s recycling bag, blushing at the empty Tampax boxes and folded Ann Summers bag pressed against the transparent plastic.</p>
<p>It took a few minutes for her to answer the door and when she did she looked flushed and flustered and a little dreamy. She was wearing a dressing gown, which Steve thought was unusual for seven in the evening, but he said nothing, just looked at his feet.</p>
<p>“Oh. Um Hi, Jessica. I hope you don’t mind. It’s just I overheard what you were talking about in the kitchen today and I have this friend who...well he breeds them, just outside of town and I thought, maybe, that this would help to cheer you up…”</p>
<p>He held the box out towards her, but she didn’t take it. Her expression ran from mortified, to confused to genuinely shocked. Mimicking Claire’s gesture from earlier, she raised her hands to cover her mouth. </p>
<p>“Oh, God...Steve! That’s really, um, really sweet of you - but when I said that my, uh ‘rabbit died’ - well...I really didn’t mean that kind of rabbit…” The box in Steve’s arms snuffled in the horrified silence.</p>
