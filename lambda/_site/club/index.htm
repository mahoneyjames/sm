I think I got it, but there’s too much uncertainty at the beginning which made me feel like I was missing something. I like the She is the cat’s mother thing and the idea of a conspiracy of dogs being overturned by cats using their love and stupidity against them (quid pro quo for what they did to humans, maybe?).
