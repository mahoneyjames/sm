Story Club was born.</p><p>Lately we have welcomed Lewis Gwyther to the executive committee despite his many failings (thank you, positive discrimination).</p><p>We now have regular contributors and an active, supportive online community of people providing feedback and helping to improve each other’s writing.</p><h1>How it works</h1><p>Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Every Wednesday a theme is shared on the home page along with three random words</li><li>Members draft a 500 word story on this theme, including the three words  (you can be as creative as you like with this)</li><li>Stories are submitted the following Wednesday (or Thursday at a push) and posted to the Story Club website</li><li>Members then leave constructive feedback on each other’s stories through the site</li><li>The  next theme is issued</li><li>Write, rinse repeat</li></ul><p>We welcome feedback from other people on stories, so please feel free to browse our back catalogue and share your thoughts, even if you’re not a current contributor.
