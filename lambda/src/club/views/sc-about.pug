                    p Story Club came about in 2016 when 
                        a(href="/a/jenny") Jenny Allan 
                        | and 
                        a(href="/a/james") James Mahoney 
                        | decided they needed an impetus to make creative writing a regular part of life.
                    p Imposing a strict set of largely ignored rules made approaching the task of creating a weekly story less intimidating and often helped inspiration to flow. Story Club was born.
                    p Lately, we have welcomed 
                        a(href="/a/lewis") Lewis Gwyther 
                        | to the executive committee despite his many failings (thank you, positive discrimination).
                    p We now have regular contributors and an active, supportive online community of people providing feedback and helping to improve each other’s writing.

                            li Every Wednesday a theme is shared on the home page along with three random words
                            li Members draft a 500 word story on this theme, including the three words  (you can be as creative as you like with this)
                            li Stories are submitted the following Wednesday (or Thursday at a push) and posted to the Story Club website
                            li Members then leave constructive feedback on each other’s stories through the site
                            li The  next theme is issued
                            li Write, rinse repeat
