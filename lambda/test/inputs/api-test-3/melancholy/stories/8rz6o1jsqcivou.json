You should probably contact ITC. Except to do that you have to raise a ticket. On the computer. With the broken screen. Instead you wander over to the coffee machine and scramble through your pockets for any loose change. Hot water 5p. Tea and Coffee 30p. You have 27p of course. Sighing you wander back to your desk.

But nothing comes up, you can’t remember when those days happened, if they even did. Everyone said their twenties were wild. But when you think about it, when you had actual legitimate fun all you can picture are flashes of scenes from television. You remember being hungover of course.

Hoping someone else can come along and change your life for you, because you’ve forgotten how.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou check your phone for the 12th time. She hasn’t messaged back. Of course.

Look away towards the lifts to the fourth floor where she will be sat, or probably stood demanding something important of someone down the phone. Maybe. Maybe she saw something in you. A glimpse of what you could have been; the elusive potential, that is so sought after and so rarely achieved. You grab another secret biscuit from the draw. Triple chocolate this week. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou reach out and pick up the phone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi, remember it’s your dental appointment on 01/03/19 at 14:45.
