He'd promised himself, one drink, in a public place, and they'd go home to their own separate \r\n\r\nbeds. He couldn't keep letting this happen, to either of them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had started six months ago. He'd been at the Annual Adoption Convention, just like he had been\r\n\r\nevery year since he'd found out Mum and Dad weren't, as such. Mary and Robert hadn't lied to him. \r\n\r\nThey said they wanted to wait until he was old enough to understand, but also have passed the \r\n\r\nhorribly hormonal and tumultuous adolescent years. Truth be told, he͛d been quite a sedate \r\n\r\nteenager; kept his head down, did well at school, had that sweet girlfriend throughout secondary \r\n\r\nwho pretty much kept him out of trouble. Sadly, they'd enrolled at universities 300 miles apart, and \r\n\r\nhad quickly discovered that young love wasn't forever, and hey, that was OK. Then, at the tender age \r\n\r\nof 21, fresh out of uni, he'd begun his life as an orphan. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, there he was, choosing his cereal at the breakfast bar, and there she was, this girl - 6 foot \r\n\r\ntall, blond, just majestic to look at - and their eyes met, and fixed, and melted. He felt this desire \r\n\r\nbubbling up inside like a volcano, and there it was, he felt like that hormonal adolescent he'd never \r\n\r\nactually been.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHer name was Sarah. She was, of course, adopted. She͛d never met her birth parents, nor did she \r\n\r\nwant to, but she'd come to the convention under the advice of her counselor, who she͛d been \r\n\r\nseeing with depression-like symptoms for about a year. She wasn't depressed, she told me over \r\n\r\ncoffee, she just had this strange emptiness inside her. Like something was masking her true self, and \r\n\r\nshe didn͛t know what. Her ex had pointed it out to her, oh so callously, as he threw his things into \r\n\r\nboxes and fled her life. You're missing something, Sarah. You're not a whole person. You're a good \r\n\r\nperson, but you're not right͛. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe'd cried. For days. But she knew he was right, and in a strange way, she was grateful to him for \r\n\r\narticulating it. That was when she͛d started seeing Dr Webb. Of course, they'd gone back over her \r\n\r\nwhole life story – a happy one at that – and it seemed that the only explanation was her orphan \r\n\r\nstatus. So she'd signed up, hopped on a plane, and there she was, at the breakfast table opposite \r\n\r\nStuart, drinking coffee and basically summarising exactly how he had always felt but also never \r\n\r\nrealised. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt hadn't taken them long to realise that they were twins. Good god, they looked as alike as two \r\n\r\npeople of opposites sexes could look, and birthdays on the same day left no doubt. And that pull, \r\n\r\nthat magnetism, the voids in each of their lives being filled by the other's sudden, unexpected, and \r\n\r\noh-so-perfect presence in one-another's lives, in each other's beds.","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yJN2h6VbonpQ9YgRJEw7DVyVEqMlbeoQnaDZrX7keTg/edit?usp=drivesdk","order":291,"format":"google","errors":[],"publicId":"not-again!","html":"<p>Stuart lay there, looking at the prone figure lying naked at his side.
