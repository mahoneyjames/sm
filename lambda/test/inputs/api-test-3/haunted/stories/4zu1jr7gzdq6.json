When the girlfriend suggested a night in the MOST HAUNTED castle in Britain he told her he could use a peaceful night away. \r\n\r\nThe place looked the part right enough, soaring stone towers topped with conical turrets of zinc, all backed by the craggy majesty of the Brecon Beacons picture postcard under a heavy blanket of snow.

This was his challenge, and no worries - load of old tosh. He tucked himself cosily inside the tartan blanket topping the bed, had another beer and watched Match of the Day.

He didn’t switch the light off though, which was handy for getting the whisky miniatures out of the mini-bar. \r\n\r\nAnd then, as the night closed its bony fingers around his lonely room, as the owls in the night screeched their mournful cries, and as the spirits of times past rose from their gloomy dens, he fell gently to sleep. \r\n\r\nBest bloody sleep he’d had in ages. The bed was perfect, the room toasty warm and that morning shower! The water beautiful and hot and stinging. \r\n\r\nHe sauntered down to breakfast, ready to bask in the adulation of all the guests who had cowered in their priest exorcised rooms through a sleepless night. \r\n\r\nHe entered the breakfast room and his blood chilled, his limbs grew cold and heavy and a great trembling began in his breast. \r\n\r\nThe room…\r\n\r\nThe horror…\r\n\r\nAll the chairs were done up in silk, the tables set with flowers and favours, tiny boxes of Turkish delight adorning each place setting. \r\n\r\nThe girlfriend caught his arm and stopped him stumbling to the carpet.
