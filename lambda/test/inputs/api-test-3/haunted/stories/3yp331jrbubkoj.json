What do they know about my good, thought Jack.  I belong here.  I belong here with my Rita, with my memories.  We had a good life here – sixty-three years together. He stood looking out of the kitchen window. In his mind’s eye he could see his Rita sitting in the blue striped deckchair in the shade of the old pear tree. She loved that spot.  Every year, when the chill of winter gave way to the gentle warmth of spring she would say ‘soon be time Jack, not long now’. Every year he would go out to the garage and get her blue striped chair down from the hook on the wall where it had been hanging all winter, waiting for this moment.
