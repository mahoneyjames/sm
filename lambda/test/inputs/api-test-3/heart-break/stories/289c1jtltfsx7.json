Mary gestured to the side of the tennis court and Roger, looking around nervously, followed her. They sat side by side on the grass watching their spouses. Roger didn’t look at Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You know they’re screwing?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary nodded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Does everyone know?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary watched Hillary bend slowly down to fetch the ball, legs apart, eyes on Nigel, who’d broken out in a sweat. She nodded again. Hillary served the ball with another orgasmic bleat. Roger looked miserably at his daps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You know” said Mary “if you wanted, we could…” She gestured. Roger looked confused, then horrified, before finally resigning himself and nodding unhappily. He followed Mary around to where the bins were at the back of the resort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey faced each other awkwardly. A bee flew past and Roger watched it intently until it had gone and he was forced to return to the task in hand. Even then he stared over Mary’s shoulder, fascinated by an unusual cactus in a window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Right. Well. Maybe put your hand here?” Mary put Roger’s hand on her breast and he held it, not knowing where to look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing impatient Mary launched herself at Roger, ramming her tongue between his lips. Roger panicked, stumbled, fell. Mary was on her back, thrashing, moaning, skirt round her hips, Roger on top of her flailing helplessly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh!” She cried “Yes!” Finally - passion, excitement, lust, everything she’d been waiting for! Roger squirmed and Mary pushed his face into hers. They struggled together on the path as Mary held Roger’s head in place with one hand and worked frantically to remove his shorts with the other. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly a shadow fell over them. Mary released Roger in shock and he sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You bastard!” said the shadow, as it turned and fled, weeping, down the path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Wait” called Roger, distraught “Nigel, wait - come back, it’s only ever been you - you know that!” He ran after him, struggling with his shorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary sat disconsolately for a moment, before standing, brushing off the dust and straightening her clothes. Slowly she walked around to the tennis court. Hillary was sitting on a bench looking defeated. Mary sat beside her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Did you know?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary shook her head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But he’s your husband!” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary shrugged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Does everyone know?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary looked across the holiday resort.
