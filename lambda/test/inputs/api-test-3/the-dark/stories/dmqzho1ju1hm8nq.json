He lay on his back in the sheer dark of his cave, cool rock beneath his naked skin more soothing than any lotion. Every day he grew more sensitive to the light.\r\n\r\n_Moonburn?_ \r\n\r\nHe would have laughed but his throat was raw from the tendrils of light that had lanced deep into his body. \r\n\r\nHe slept for many hours. He slept as the sun drowned out the cries of the moon, reaching its zenith and then beginning its slow descent once more. It was a nagging grain of sand in his mind, millions of miles distant, and how many miles of rock now between them and yet still he could feel it. It did not matter which way he forced himself to sleep, when he awoke he was always facing the sun, as though some deep instinctual part of his mind knew to never turn his back on this enemy that seared his eyes and burned his skin. \r\n\r\nFrom his bag he took the bottle of Crested Grebe and poured himself a measure. This was the one burn he enjoyed, because it was his choice to inflict it upon himself. He settled himself cross legged, took up his reader and connected the power cable. He lay it face down upon his thighs, waiting for that moment, that tingle, as the bonds of the interface formed themselves into the ridges and bumps of the living tactile interface. \r\n\r\nHe inserted the storage card and felt another tingle as the device quivered again.
