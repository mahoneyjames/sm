This. is. heavy...”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stared off into the distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is but six miles to our lodging, Inclementia…” he trailed off seeing her red face and damp armpits.

Maybe if there was blood…?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You’re anaemic Adrian and I’m buggered if I’m cutting myself for some undead arsehole.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey weren’t speaking when they got back to the room. She slammed the door behind them, yelling:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“We’re ridiculous Adrian, we look like twats.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“People fear what…”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No-one fears us Adrian, everyone’s laughing because we’re dressed like fucking storybook characters. Vampires aren’t real!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe look of shock and hurt that spread across his face made her sorry immediately. It was like telling a 6-year-old that Father Christmas had died, but before she could apologise he’d locked himself in the bathroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSitting on the toilet Adrian ignored her apologetic tappings.

They had all heard them fighting, and hadn’t she been dressed like a crazy vampire obsessive? Who else would kill someone like that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd nobody noticed the faint smile and strangely elongated teeth on Balthazar’s face as he lay motionless in his pool of blood on the bathroom floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t7RRfaymlhUTIqjytN5mP7QI5m0cehxM6JmyBzjEVcU/edit?usp=drivesdk","order":226,"format":"google","errors":[],"publicId":"biting-back","html":"<p>Biting back</p>\n<p>Balthazar blinked in the bright sunshine as he hauled his heavy suitcase out of Sigisoara’s tiny airport.
