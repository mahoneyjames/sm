It was golden and topped with delicate pastry stars and moons. Steam piping through the bird’s beak poking the crust filled the kitchen with the heady scent of rich red wine and herbs from the garden.

His was always in the hands-free cradle, always. But why not call? Why not just call and say, darling, we’re five minutes out? Just this once it was in his pocket, and the ringer would startle him, he’d twitch the wheel, get it back, car steady on the narrow twisty lanes. Then he would dig in his pocket for the phone, in the pocket trapped by the seatbelt, and just for a moment he’d use his elbow to steady the wheel and pull out some slack with his other hand. \r\n\r\nOr the car was already upside down, rear lights cosy red beneath the closing fingers of mist that would closet them from the road.

He wondered about the awful mountain of unwashed dishes for such a thrown together tea. \r\n\r\nHe asked her, wasn’t there wonderful pie you’ve been planning?
