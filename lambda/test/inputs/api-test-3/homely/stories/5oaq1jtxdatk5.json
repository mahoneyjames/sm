It had seemed a fairly ordinary day, when I had awoken in my 2nd floor flat in east London (not the cool bit, sad to say). How was I now in Berlin, sitting outside a bar, surrounded by a drunk party of stags dressed as pirates shouting ‘avast ye, landlubbers’ and other ludicrous stereotypy at the top of their lungs while they pretended to fight one another with invisible swords and calling anyone over a B cup who had the misfortune to pass by ‘busty wenches’.

It seemed excessively still and calm in there after the rowdy hubbub outside, in which the only words I could understand came from the stag party.

I was lying on the floor of the cubicle, one arm bent backwards and trailing up the wall behind me, legs in child’s pose, and the other hand extended into the adjacent cubicle. I tried to stand, and felt the blood rushing back into my legs, so wobbled myself onto the toilet seat. This made even less sense. Had the sausage been spiked? But if so, why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI left the lavatories, completely discombobulated. I didn’t know what time it was, and until I reached the darkened street and noticed the German on the signs above the closed shops and closing bars, I’d forgotten that I was even in Berlin. The table I’d occupied with fit-but-thick earlier was empty. Well, if it had been him who’d spiked me, he’d clearly given up waiting. The floor was scattered with fag butts and bottle tops, sticky with spillages.
