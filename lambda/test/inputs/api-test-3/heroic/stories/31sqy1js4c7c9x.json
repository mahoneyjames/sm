The pregnant pause when you realised who I was in the darkness and confusion; the beautiful moment when you knew, when it clicked, that you deserved what was to come, the realisation in your wide, bright eyes that of course it would be terrible.

An eye for an eye, and all that. I wanted you to suffer, like she suffered. And I made certain that you did, I’m sure you will agree. I’m not sure how long we have been down here together, but I have made each moment last - each one a perfect eternity. And nothing was wasted. I know that you will appreciate that.

Everything exactly where it should be. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The frightening snap of bone, the sound that fingernails make as they are dragged across concrete for the tenth, twelfth, thirtieth time._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the last bright drops of life drain out of your eyes, it is, after all of your begging, finally over.
