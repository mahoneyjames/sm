It was a telly-addicts paradise where visitors were invited to share “magical moments” with astonishingly detailed robots who exactly resembled the original actors.

She smiled through gritted teeth in her Beebland Tabard as she helped pensioners who’d fallen through the bar in Only Fools and Horses back to their feet, or led them to the shop where they requested fork handles from robotic Ronnie Corbett.
