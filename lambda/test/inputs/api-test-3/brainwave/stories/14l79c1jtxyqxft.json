The sun beat down on the mourners at the graveside, crowded between ornate headstones and wreaths that were already wilting in the heat.

He hadn’t moved in the same illustrious circles as Anton, so he still experienced a thrill when exposed to the glamour of his brothers career, a life filled with award ceremonies, private yachts, and beautiful women (and beautiful boys, if the tabloids were to be believed). Not that it was any use to him now, poor bugger, his cancer ridden body lifeless in the coffin being slowly lowered into the ground. Tobias looked around at the heads lowered in prayer.

Even when Anton was Bafta nominated for his role as Tsar Nicholas II, he had never forgiven ‘that smug bastard Suchet’ for his betrayal. That had been the end for him really, losing out to a prime time TV detective at the awards, which had led to a loss of spirit, and faith in his craft that he never regained.

A fitting tribute that Tobias was sad to miss, but he’d already risked too much attending the funeral. He slipped into his own modest VW Polo and ran the aircon as cold as he could. It had all been Tobias’ idea, genius that it was. Lung cancer, only three months to live. Anton desperate to slip into obscurity. And they looked so similar, any differences were overlooked by a wad of cash discretely slipped into the funeral director’s hands. He eased the car out of the cemetery gates, the paparazzi packing up their cameras, nothing more to see. Anton smiled as he prepared to take on the most challenging acting role of his life, the mundane life of Tobias Buchanan.
