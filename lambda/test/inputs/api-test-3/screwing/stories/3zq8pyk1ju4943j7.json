Don’t wait up’ scrawled in crayon on the back of an old Cineworld ticket and held in place with a Coca Cola fridge magnet.\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nMike snatched the note from the fridge and crumpled it in his hand. Jesus, he thought, if his wife was going to lie to him, she should at least do her homework. He’d filled up with petrol on the way home, slipping a sneaky pack of 20 Marlboro onto the bill, hoping Julie wouldn't notice when she did the receipts at the end of the month. It was Sandra who had served him in the garage, leering at him over the till, oh so casually undoing another button on her too tight polyester uniform. Mike was mesmerised by the way her name badge jiggled just above her right breast. ‘Evening, sexy’ she ran her tongue around her bubblegum pink lips. ‘Always a pleasure to see you in here. I finish at 8,’ she passed him his receipt, her hand brushing his. ‘Julie’s out tonight, isn't she? If you fancy some company.’ Mike blushed, ‘Thanks Sandra, but I don’t think so, do you? What with me being married, and you being married?’ Sandra shrugged, ‘Well if you change your mind ….’\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\nAs he stared at the crumpled note of lies, thoughts raced through his head. All the times over the last couple of months that Julie had gone out alone, often not taking her mobile, and never answering it when she did. And how did Sandra know Julie wouldn't be home tonight? And where the hell was she anyway? He took a cigarette from the pack and lit it over the gas hob. He dialled Julie's number, but wasn't surprised when she didn't answer. After the third attempt he gave up. Wherever she was, and whatever she was doing, fuck it, let her her get on with it. He checked the time and reached again for his phone. Two can play at that game. Sandra answered on the second ring. ‘Changed your mind, have you?’ The image of Sandra’s jiggling breasts diminished any guilt he was feeling about his errant wife. ‘Yeah, come on over.’\r\n\r\n\rAnd they were even more delightful in real, naked life, Mike thought, as he pushed her out the front door an hour later. He was straightening the cushions on the sofa when he heard Julie’s keys in the door. ‘Hellooooo’ she shouted down the hall. Her face was flushed pink, and she was holding an ornately carved wooden coat stand. ‘Ta da’ she thrust the coat stand towards Mike. ‘It’s a surprise. For your birthday. I know it’s a couple of week’s away but I finished it tonight and wanted you to have it.’ Mike took the coat stand, the confusion on his face apparent because Julie continued ‘I’ve been doing a woodwork course.
