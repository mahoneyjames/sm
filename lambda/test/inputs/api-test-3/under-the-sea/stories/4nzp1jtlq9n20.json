Belowdecks was warm but up here was the sky and the good sea air to fill their lungs. \r\n\r\nMaybe it was the Elton John sat on a bench facing them, back hunched resolute against the breaking spray.

His kind were well out of it, long gone from Blighty before this hell.\r\n\r\nA choke from the engine, silence broken slowly as a murmur of unease rippled through the passengers.

End of the trip, unless…\r\n\r\nStuart didn’t move. Habit held his wallet with him still, but this deal not even cash only. You have a wedding ring? You have something with a diamond? Stuart with a wallet built on plastic, everything not nailed down sold for this ticket. \r\n\r\nAs the lifeboat motor faded so to the broiling anger that scorned the fleeing crew. No mourning for the blood in the scuppers or bodies that twitched in example. \r\n\r\nPeace had come, but not silence. People with tears to cry, Gods to call on. \r\n\r\nStuart Meadows sitting arm in arm with wifey, hands squeezed tight. \r\n\r\nHe said, ‘But the boys got out before the French closed the tunnels.’\r\n\r\nA squeeze of his hand the only reply.\r\n\r\nIt can’t be Elton sitting there. Real Elton with a pocket full of rubies but theirs is statue still, the only life a trickle from beneath the rims of his glasses.
