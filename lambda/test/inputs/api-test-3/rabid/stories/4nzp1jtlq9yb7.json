It was dominated by a full colour photo and for a moment Dafydd could only see the vision in the centre, Gwenllian of the blue eyes and hair like the sun, small frame at odds with the hugeness of her fervour. It took him a moment to work out the rest of the photo; a pair of figures squaring up to each other, one with fisted arm stretched long, the other caught mid-twist, face puckered into fish lips. \r\n\r\nDavid Smith looked up at the sergeant grinning back at him. \r\n\r\n‘Here’s your gear. ‘Phone, wallet, keys. And maybe these still work.’ He grinned harder as he pushed a pair of cracked and bent sunglasses across the desk. \r\n\r\nDavid Smith trudged home behind broken sunglasses and a face that was throbbing. He went round the back of the house, Dad’s hammock sitting inviting on the back lawn. That’s what he was going to do, beers and the hammock and nothing else. \r\n\r\nThe kitchen laminate was strangely bouncy underfoot, and in places there were swollen lumps.
