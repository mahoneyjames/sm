Perhaps once they would have laughed and ran to greet them in amazement. But civilisation has balked at their ways and turned young ones wonder to horror. The men now mutter to their wives or talk in hushed voices in the alehouse. Casting furtive glances at every tinkle and tap outside. The toot of a horn sends shivers down spines. Fear and hatred now drawn in equal measure with each breath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside each doorstep the villagers leave some food or drink that they remember to be fitting; sometimes a cream pie or scones, ginger beer or ice cream.  An offering that ensures this ragged troupe of unwelcome oddities keep tumbling onwards.  They can travel through, but they are not allowed to stop. These unwanted are someone else's entertainment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are driven here by hatred. Haunted by the distant memory of their last clap.  A longing in their sole to be accepted again, to be cheered, to be laughed at, to be loved. Some have travelled thousands of miles, their once song-filled voices silenced by animosity or indifference. Oversized shoes now threadbare and broken, spinning flowers dry of their last drop of water, black top hats faded to gray long since void of fluffy tailed life. A flight of fools, no longer needed with only one place left to go. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe greets them all. He knows the painted look on every face, each faded cloak, each broken wand. They will all find a place in his carnival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you listen carefully in the quiet of the night  you can hear the music carried across on the wind, the playful haunting sounds of the tinkling music, the laughter, the creak of the machines whirring to life and bringing joy once more to those who once brought it to the world.  Here on this island of Barry, their fairground salvation lies, one last show, one final bow. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lyT0ODg5wktVcVWF9LqgG1oHXyS6TOxbcKLpJYTpNo8/edit?usp=drivesdk","order":277,"format":"google","errors":[],"publicId":"the-island","html":"<p>He sits upon his twisted tower of broken metal.
