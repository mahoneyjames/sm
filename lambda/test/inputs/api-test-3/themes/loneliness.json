Juicy Lucy pouting, bending, hands caressing silky pink skin still shower slick, fingers creeping the taut curve of her belly, quivering closer for the tight lines of her Brazilian wax. Eyes in the mirror, eyes right into Iain’s soul, and there it was, his Big Moment, and then preparations for Big Night could resume for the third time. \r\n\r\nAfter he had put the cushions back to neatness and turned Nana’s photo on the mantelpiece round the right way.\r\n\r\nHim and Juicy Lucy together for how long was it? Nursery, so his Nana reckoned, and he remembered primary school, this blur of golden curls pretty much every one of his memories. High school the high point, both of them top set everything, time and again top girl and top boy on stage for their awards. It didn’t matter she went to unit without him, those dark twenties, they were behind them now. Him and Juicy Lucy together again at last. It was going to be perfect. \r\n\r\nThey were having duck, Gressingham duck breasts, skin lovingly massaged with fine Maldon salt, crisped to a heavenly crunch then placed – skin side up – in the oven to allow the thick layer of fat to render into a delicious sauce. He’d heard her talking, duck her favourite, but she’d never have duck like this. The bought special wine thermometer said her favourite Chardonnay was at the perfect temperature, but there was also three different kinds of foreign beer because he was sure he’d heard her mention it just as the lift doors closed. \r\n\r\nThe dining room was already perfect, Nana’s best china and cutlery, and obviously pride of place given to her hand crocheted placements she saved for best. \r\n\r\nIain took himself up to his Nana’s room and stood in front of her full length mirror. He was already the man in black, everything dull black, nothing that reflects. He had a pot of black camouflage paint into which he dipped two fingers then began to draw circles around his eyes. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nLucy Coslett did own a full length of mirror but the only naked it reflected was a blur as she scurried past.

When the bell rang again she opened the door. Duncan grinned back at her. He raised both shopping laden arms aloft. Before he’d even set the bags on the kitchen counter she snuck the wine. \r\n\r\n‘Chilled already, you wonderful man!’\r\n\r\nThe first decent gulp of Chardonnay began to work its magic. \r\n\r\n‘God, I need this,’ Lucy said. ‘After the week I’ve had.’ \r\n\r\n‘He’s still, uh…?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh God, yes.
