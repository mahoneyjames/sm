But, Rosa reasoned, it wasn’t fair to be such a burden on Carol and the grandkids. It wasn’t up to them to keep her company now that she found herself so suddenly alone. She smiled wistfully at their crayon scribbles pinned up around her dressing table and resolutely swiped right. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was meeting Mike - or was it Nigel? Better check.

She planned to get in, turn on the radio to drown out the awful silence and make some biscuits that nobody but she would eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the rain began in earnest. She hadn’t brought her brolly and, almost without thinking, Rosa ducked into the nearest shop to shelter from the deluge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a hardware shop. She’d never been in one before, but there was something about the smell in there she liked. It felt solid. Real.

Rosa thought she’d need screws, so she picked up a packet, but she was beginning to feel a bit overwhelmed by the array of products.
