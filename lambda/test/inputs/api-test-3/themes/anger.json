His body cold against the stone wall. “What the hell?” He mumbled trying to see through the dim light. He was naked. His wrists were sore from handcuffs, chained above his head to the wall. “Daisy?.. hello, anyone?” He shouted into the dark unsure if he wanted a reply. His throat burned with thirst. Worst of all he could remember nothing. Someone must be looking for me. Daisy would come find him. Surely. \r\n\r\nHe jerked awake again. What was that, he thought? A distant torch flickered across the wall and eventually on to him. \r\n\r\n“Darling”, came a cry. “Oh thank god.”\r\n\r\n“Daisy, thank you. Help me. Quick get me down” he cried in despair and delight.\r\n\r\n“Are you ok?” Daisy asked, concern in her voice.\r\n\r\n“I’m fine. Just hurry up and unlock me.” He replied desperate to be free. Tom breathed a sigh of relief as he saw Daisy pull a key from her pocket.\r\n\r\n“Do you love me?” Daisy asked quietly. \r\n\r\n“What? Unlock me Daisy quickly my wrist are in agony.” Tom replied confused. \r\n\r\n“Do you love me?” Daisy asked again, firmer this time.\r\n\r\n“Yes of course I love you.” He laughed, still confused. “But please get me out before whoever did this comes back.” \r\n\r\n“Strange then really.” Daisy said, turning her back on him. “You know the garden has been looking so nice. But needs must and Gardners can be replaced.”\r\n\r\n“Look Daisy, what’s going on. Where am I and for Christs sake get me out of here.” Tom’s confusion turned to anger as he spoke.\r\n\r\nDaisy turned to face him. “You know the funny thing about you Tom? You have this image of what is is to be a Man; strong, proud always in the right, always thinking you can take what you want.  But i’m afraid being a real man, well there is more to it than that.  You! You can’t even tell me you’re not ok when your chained naked to a wall.” She laughed at this then continued calmly.  “You think being a man is just about one thing. But there’s more to it then sex.”\r\n\r\nTom was frantically wriggling, as useless as a hooked worm. Pleasing now to be released and that he knew nothing about any of this. Daisy dissapeared into a dark corner of the room., where her voice drifted back to him. “She tripped and you fell? It just happened didn’t it? She is a gorgeous Gardner to be fair to you. Well she was anyway.” Her voice sounded as beautiful and as barbed as a rose.\r\n\r\nShe walked slowly back into the light and he flinched back as he saw what was in her hand. She scraped the grey metal along the floor, the teeth sang as they danced along. And their song was hungry and sharp.\r\n\r\n“Oh dear.” She said looking down at him. “Your rose seems a little wilted.”\r\n\r\n“Look darling this is all just a misunderstanding, if you can just unlock me.” Tom grovelled.\r\n\r\n“And you know what happens to wilted roses” Daisy continues unhearing. “they need to be dead-headed.” \r\n\r\nTom froze, disbelief in his eyes. “Ok look calm down. I’m sorry. Is that what you want from me? This is insane. You can’t do this. This is crazy Daisy.” His words gushed out like dirt from a fallen pot.\r\n\r\nDaisy gripped the saw tightly. “You know I don’t think you are ok Tom. In fact i don't even think you are worthy to be a man anymore.” And this time the saw sung out a different song.

Keiko is standing by my bed. She wears a prim white lab coat that brushes the floor.\r\n\r\n‘Good morning,’ she says brightly, and sweeps the covering from my naked body. She helps me from the bed and ushers me through the door leading to the shower stall. The water is hot and invigorating, but I slump, this wilted rose watching petals of himself washing down the plughole. \r\n\r\nKeiko enters the shower stall nude. I feel nothing. I am sixty-three, sixty-four, something like that. I don’t know, are they getting younger? They replace my attendants every few months. Perhaps it’s simply that I’m getting older. She joins me in the shower to wash me. There is much body contact between my wrinkles and her firm young skin, and my body begins to wake. \r\n\r\nI want breakfast. Food is what I look forward to these days, but no. We enter the booth. Suspended from the ceiling is the dull black dome of the simulation helmet and I don it eagerly, leaving this sterile box for the pleasant warmth of a grassy meadow. In the real-world Keiko is carefully attaching the sensors to my body parts. As a boy it would turn me on, but now, all I wish for is this moment of peace before the program begins.\r\n\r\nI stand in a barn, a row of cows watching me, lowing gently as they await their turn. A milkmaid is squatting low on a milking stool. Clasped between her thighs is a wooden cylinder. She enthusiastically raises and lowers the plunger of the button churn, breasts jiggling from her woefully inadequate top until at last they dance free.\r\n\r\nA few moments later we are having sex. \r\n\r\nShe writhes beneath my prowess, matching the cows bellow for bellow. Time was and they used to put some thought into this stuff. Now it’s wham, bang, and thank you, sir. \r\n\r\nBut it does not matter how theatrically the milkmaid dances. Nothing doing. They can pump my body full of drugs, they can cram in millions of pleasure sensors per square inch. I’ve had thirty-three years of this shit. \r\n\r\nThe barn door is suddenly flung back with a bang. The milkmaid screams.\r\n\r\nA man is silhouetted in the doorway. He enters the barn, levels his shotgun and fires. I hug the naked girl beneath me, leaning back up just in time to duck as he swings the shotgun wildly. I punch him in the gut, I punch him in the face, then seize the gun and wield it as a club. The milkmaid does not stop writhing. \r\n\r\nThis man staggers to the wall of the barn and pulls down a rusty bandsaw. \r\n\r\nAnd I know his face. I know his puce skin and I know those temples with those bulging veins. You don’t forget your first time, and this is the husband of my first time. Yes, it was for the good of the species, and yes, he was sterile, but he could not take it, his wife paired off with a fourteen-year-old boy. \r\n\r\nHe stalks closer, and the saw murmurs with the rumble of summer thunder as it enters the back swing.\r\n\r\nThe barn dissolves into black. The helmet is pulled from my head. \r\n\r\n‘Good job,’ Keiko says. ‘Time for breakfast.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pfgUjzkMlrkUi0j7-RQJWnGa6MZ7SNDbTnwnwiJ3aRw/edit?usp=drivesdk","order":301,"format":"google","errors":[],"publicId":"the-milking-shed","html":"<p>I wake.

She joins me in the shower to wash me. There is much body contact between my wrinkles and her firm young skin, and my body begins to wake. </p>\n<p>I want breakfast. Food is what I look forward to these days, but no. We enter the booth. Suspended from the ceiling is the dull black dome of the simulation helmet and I don it eagerly, leaving this sterile box for the pleasant warmth of a grassy meadow. In the real-world Keiko is carefully attaching the sensors to my body parts. As a boy it would turn me on, but now, all I wish for is this moment of peace before the program begins.</p>\n<p>I stand in a barn, a row of cows watching me, lowing gently as they await their turn. A milkmaid is squatting low on a milking stool. Clasped between her thighs is a wooden cylinder. She enthusiastically raises and lowers the plunger of the button churn, breasts jiggling from her woefully inadequate top until at last they dance free.</p>\n<p>A few moments later we are having sex. </p>\n<p>She writhes beneath my prowess, matching the cows bellow for bellow. Time was and they used to put some thought into this stuff. Now it’s wham, bang, and thank you, sir. </p>\n<p>But it does not matter how theatrically the milkmaid dances. Nothing doing. They can pump my body full of drugs, they can cram in millions of pleasure sensors per square inch. I’ve had thirty-three years of this shit. </p>\n<p>The barn door is suddenly flung back with a bang. The milkmaid screams.</p>\n<p>A man is silhouetted in the doorway. He enters the barn, levels his shotgun and fires. I hug the naked girl beneath me, leaning back up just in time to duck as he swings the shotgun wildly. I punch him in the gut, I punch him in the face, then seize the gun and wield it as a club. The milkmaid does not stop writhing. </p>\n<p>This man staggers to the wall of the barn and pulls down a rusty bandsaw. </p>\n<p>And I know his face. I know his puce skin and I know those temples with those bulging veins. You don’t forget your first time, and this is the husband of my first time. Yes, it was for the good of the species, and yes, he was sterile, but he could not take it, his wife paired off with a fourteen-year-old boy. </p>\n<p>He stalks closer, and the saw murmurs with the rumble of summer thunder as it enters the back swing.</p>\n<p>The barn dissolves into black. The helmet is pulled from my head. </p>\n<p>‘Good job,’ Keiko says. ‘Time for breakfast.’</p>\n","authorUser":{"id":"james","publicId":"james","name":"James","disqusId":"disqus_I3Y90i5a4f","joined":"2016-11-02","about":{"link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O91wBAy0993sF5fPh5WMKiy3QRDrb-FOJ_CL_CRFapw/edit","format":"google","content":"I am James.
