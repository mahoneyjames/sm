Each shriek and each moan makes me tingle, but it’s not what you might be thinking.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning I guess it’s best to start, at that Uni politics dinner when Amanda launched a Yorkshire pudding wrapped around a pepper pot at the fat Tory MP when he was knocking out Rule Britannia on the out of tune piano. There was this blaze to her eyes as they marched her out of there, this blaze of spunk that made me chase on after. Together ever since, from the tail of Brown’s sorry premiership and all the leaders since, both of us true red Labour, but I guess if you’re a couple known as Peter and Mandy you’ve kind of got to be. At our wedding we launched paper lanterns inscribed with quotes from the party manifesto. \r\n\r\nSorry. Digression. Why is it that the painting shivering on the wall because of head board thumping gives me such joy?\r\n\r\nOf course, you’ll have done the post coital deepest fantasy pillow talk. I’ll be clear, when I raised the subject there was this tiny part of me that somehow hoped that Mandy’s deepest was for Sandy, from my office, to join us for an athletic threesome. \r\n\r\nBut what Mandy actually said. \r\n\r\nMy God. \r\n\r\nThe depravity. \r\n\r\nThe shame of it, just to think of all those times I did try – I really did – those times when I stripped naked, did my face up as she wanted and then marched on into the bedroom only to find that Mr Happy was sulking. \r\n\r\nIt sure drives a wedge, when you cannot bring yourself to bed your own wife. \r\n\r\nIt was attempt number four that brought me to this bedroom next to where someone else’s Mr Happy was being Mr Busy. It was this year’s Labour conference, and Mandy was there by herself, because obviously I couldn’t be in love with her any more if I couldn’t bring myself to do that for her. It was spur of the moment that I took the room next to her. The staff there knew us both – hadn’t missed a conference in ten years. I explained I was there to surprise her, and they happily gave me a key for the connecting door. Then it was strip down, face on, Viagra inserted. Three seconds of Maggie’s coffin on its way into the church was enough for Mr Happy to wake and then I was through that door. \r\n\r\nI went into a room of horror. A room in which my naked wife rode a naked man. This woman with her back to me but with my wife’s hair and with my wife’s rose tattoo on her right shoulder. She had my wife’s nearly come face too, hazy eyes that opened wide in sheer horror as she looked through my grey face whiskers to the man dying beneath. She screamed and entered the en-suite without touching the floor. \r\n\r\nHer lover shot from the bed and we faced each other, both of us naked, both of us bearded. Together our eyes flicked down and then as one we tore the Jeremy Corbyn beards from our faces and clasped them to our nethers. Without his beard he had an owlish look to him, this weed of a man  who’d been doing my wife. \r\n\r\nI went for his beard, my intention to strip him of this shred of dignity and then leave him and his shame in the corridor. Rather more moist flesh than I intended, but it did serve as a convenient handle with which to lead him yelping from the bedroom. \r\n\r\nThat’s it, you’re caught up. That’s how we got to now, my wife in the bed next door screaming to Jeremy that she’s coming again. Silence now, the deed is done. And I cannot wait for my wife’s next scream, when I go in there and tell her the man done up as the Labour leader is really a Tory party activist.

We liked each other; took turns tending the communal garden, collected each others mail, shared meals in one anothers’ kitchens, looked after baby Daisy when Alison worked shifts...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut not Hector. He lived on the top floor, my floor, and never joined in or did his share. He played his loud, out-of-tune piano when everyone was asleep on a Saturday morning. He smoked in his flat and pretended he didn’t. He even fell asleep running his bath, flooding poor Derek’s living room, ruining his collection of paper lanterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, none of us liked sharing the building with Hector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt didn’t surprise us when an oddly shaped box appeared outside his flat, blocking the corridor, his name printed clearly on the top. I had to lift up my bike to pass it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was still there when I got home, so I decided that something must be done. I rapped smartly on his door and arranged my features to convey polite firmness. He peered through his horn-rimmed spectacles, brushing matter from his brown, threadbare dressing gown. His hair tufted in white clumps at the sides of his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hector?” I began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who?” he asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Mr Bagshaw?” I corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who’re you looking for, missy?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hector I’m looking for you - there’s a parcel…”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sorry, wrong flat.

I was confused, but let it pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil it happened again; Alison fell over it and he’d said the same to her.

It was certainly an unusual shape and alarmingly large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy morning, it had vanished. As I wheeled my bike out Mr Thatcher gave me a knowing look. We knew what had to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen another package appeared in the hall, no-one wasted time asking Hector. Together we dragged it into my kitchen and opened it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well” said Derek “I never expected that.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Thatcher whistled. “Who’d have thought  - at his age too!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI reached down and lifted it out.

I had to think fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who?” I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“MISS Jones…”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who?” I asked innocently “Who are you looking for, sir?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now look here, that box is mine - you’ve no right…”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, I don’t know who you mean.
