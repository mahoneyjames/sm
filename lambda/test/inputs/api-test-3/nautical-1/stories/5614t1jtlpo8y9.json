Kal was naked, hopping on one foot as he tried to get back in his jeans, but at the same time unable to tear his eyes away from the man in the bed. Though not a whole man.

She let him get his fingers on the front door handle before she caught him in a spell of Holding. It was a Shift spell to get him into the kitchen, and then a bunch more Holdings to get him pulled tight into a star shape. \r\n\r\nSandra picked up her boning scissors and showed them to him.

He began to whimper as she sank slowly to her knees. His begging ceased to be words and became a high-pitched whine as she wrapped her left hand around his cock and pulled it taught. \r\n\r\n‘Snippy, snippy…’ \r\n\r\nHe screamed blue agony when she put the heel of her foot hard into his balls. It was a scream of pity and horror when she stood and showed him the pork and apple bronze medal winning sausage, snipped end dipped in ketchup. \r\n\r\nHe passed out when she threw it in the frying pan and it began to sizzle. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mfdm2OV1ZP4Ua4Ut1i94v43plh-KDygX_6YIAd6W0HE/edit?usp=drivesdk","order":118,"format":"google","errors":[],"publicId":"sausages","html":"<p>It was a bitch having the Sight – eating out was a kitchen horror show, and the things that happened in toilet cubicles.
