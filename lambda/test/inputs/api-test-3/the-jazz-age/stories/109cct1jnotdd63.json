Pouting in towards to glass, she pressed the lipstick on to her pallid lips spreading a thick layer to each corner of her mouth. Her breath temporarily misted up a circle of her reflection as she blew herself a kiss. Stepping back to inspect her outfit, Dorothea felt ready. Her neat bob was held back from her face by a chic feather headband. Her delicate drop waist silk dress was so fashionable with its tiers of fabric creating fullness from the waist down. The elegant beads that adorned it caught glimmers of light from the old Tiffany lamp in the corner of the room. Rolling on her full length gloves, she turned to give herself one more inspection from all sides.\r\n\r\n“Dotty, come on! You look fabulous, you always look fabulous! We’re gonna be late, you know how I hate being late!” Dorothea’s roommate Mary was standing in the doorway pulling a modest lace shawl over her shoulders. \r\n\r\n“We can be late, let them wait. We don’t have to come runnin’ when the call you know.” Dorothea opened her wardrobe and paused for a moment to choose a covering. “Hhmm, maybe I won’t” she said and closed the wardrobe door.\r\n\r\n“Dorothea... ”\r\n\r\n“I’ll give them indecent exposure” Dorothea said pointedly.\r\n\r\nMary gave a nervous laugh and grabbed a set of keys from the sideboard. “OK, but I’m driving.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 148 Club was in the most exclusive part of Chicago. Entry was by invite only and rumour had it that the party never stopped. Dorothea had longed to cross its notorious threshold ever since she moved up from Bloomington. She had arrived in the city two months prior carrying with her just a small suitcase which had been frantically packed in a last minute dash from her parent’s house. Her worldly possessions reduced to just a few items of clothes and of course her beloved photo of Clara Bow. Dorothea had always been a spirited girl but when her parents caught her climbing back into the house through a bedroom window at 3 in the morning, it was the final straw. \r\n\r\n“Good evening ladies.” The elegant doorman held back a heavy velvet curtain and ushered them in. At the front of the room there was a modest looking stage with opulent drapes and brass floodlight casting a pool of light into the centre.\r\n\r\nAnother usher appeared. “Your host would be delighted if you would join him for a drink before the show.” He gestured towards a table set back in a booth to the side of the stage. Prime viewing but secluded from the rest of the guests.\r\n\r\n“Hhmm, of course he would. Well, you’d better bring a couple’a Gin Rickey’s then.” Dorothea winked at Mary as they turned and started towards the table. As they approached, the seated figure paused his conversation and turned to greet his guests.\r\n\r\n“You gals made it along huh?”\r\n\r\n“Of course we did, Al.”\r\n\r\n","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b5R-vXWrB6na2gRqonqo05h9ym97VlZb8wJlK5KSYLc/edit","order":12,"format":"google","errors":[],"publicId":"all-that-jazz","html":"<p>Standing in front of the mirror, she unfurled a baton of vibrant red from its tubular container.
