It rang as he shuffled over the pink roses in the carpet and it kept on sounding as he steadied himself on the door frame before lunging to the second walker in the hall.

Put that next to your cat, it would be like a mirror.’\r\n\r\nHe put his face to the gap.\r\n\r\n‘Madam, please leave me alone.
