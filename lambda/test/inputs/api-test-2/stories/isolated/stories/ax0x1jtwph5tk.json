I remember the life next to me in that cosy space and the knowledge that I wasn't alone. I swear I can still feel the sense of security and comfort of that moment.

The warmth of our cocoon was ruptured in a craze of blood and metal. Cold air swooped over my naked skin and into the gap created between us - the shock making me yell and scream. Bundled up into well-worn but clean blankets, I was held in a vice like grip and rushed to the heated cot. Lungs that were barely able to gulp in air were not big or strong enough to relay the total panic and fear I felt. Where was my mirror?

They didn’t care for my cries, cries were a good sign, they were a vocal display of my survival. I had been saved and that’s what mattered. The cot made everything else seem so distant and muted.

My daily commute takes me across London and for 45 minutes it is probably the only place I can feel close to you again. I've tried to find peace everywhere - hill tops in India, tropical shores in the Caribbean, remote farmhouses in Scotland. They all gave me the tranquil setting I was looking for but did nothing for the inner turmoil. I needed to be 'held' by human life but couldn't stand anyone too close. I found my solace in a city of 10 million people and in the heated cot of the tube.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have no proof but I feel somehow that you are still out there waiting for your turn. Maybe you should have had this life and I have just borrowed it for now. Maybe when I give it back, you will blossom and be the stronger half that I never was.","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/10vgcpqXSw2yaV9Bpb3u09URrOnSDkiu6n5BL2DxPYxI/edit?usp=drivesdk","order":240,"format":"google","errors":[],"publicId":"one-side-of-the-story","html":"<p>They say I can&#39;t possibly remember but I do, I know I do.
