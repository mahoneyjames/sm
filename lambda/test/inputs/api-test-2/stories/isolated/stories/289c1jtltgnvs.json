Inside the place was a wreck; unwashed dishes, papers scattered, trailing up to the room where the light stood, grimey and neglected. The walls were streaked with filth and what looked like swirls and patterns drawn in blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the other side of the lighthouse, the side that faced the infinitely stretching sea, Peter found Sam stretched out across the rocks.
