Me and the wife have been coming here regularly for 6 years now and we’ve not come across anything like this before.”  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Offal added, “back home people think we’re a pair of freaks, but out here they can’t get enough of us.  It’s like we’re a tourist attraction in our own right!  We feel like celebrities.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Offal found the body of Barry Epworth, a 35 year old father of 9 from Scunthorpe, lying at the edge of the water.  “We saw something which looked a bit strange and we thought it was a dead badger.  On closer examination, we realised it wasn’t a badger, but a man covered in hedgehog excrement.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Epworth from Crowle in Scunthorpe was holidaying with his wife, Janice, when the untimely incident occurred.  Mrs Epworth said her husband got up very early the morning before and walked to the bridge alone.  When he returned, he said that after witnessing the numerous nudists and bystanders it attracted, he had never seen anything like it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“He was drawn to the place,” Janice said.  “I’ve been a nudist for years but Barry was a bit of a prude really.  I tried to get him to strip off loads of times at home and just let it all hang out, but he just wouldn’t have any of it.”  Mrs Epworth added, “it was starting to drive a massive wedge between us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Mr Epworth returned from his morning walk at Heundeul Dali Bridge (translated as The Wobbly Bridge) he was enthusiastic and told his wife they would return before the end of their two week trip and he would strip off and feel proud as he walked alongside the other nudists.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The funny side of this is, we weren’t even supposed to come here.  I’d booked to stay in Dong-Gu, which is just outside the town but the hotel was fully booked and we were sent here at the last minute.  Mrs Epworth smiled as she recalled her husband saying it was serendipity which had brought them there, adding “I am really sad that I never got to walk along the bridge with him.” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice have released a statement saying, “tourists and new people to the area are unaware of the potential dangers of walking across the wobbly bridge.  Our advice is to remain vigilant, and where possible, try to avoid walking across that particular bridge.  However, if it is unavoidable and you have to walk across, under no circumstances do it alone.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThey have asked for anyone who may have seen Mr Epworth with any hedgehogs, to please come forward.
