Wait a minute, was that really YMCA he could hear?  Sniffing the air, he turned his head towards the sound, but he was disoriented.  Where was it coming from?  It took all the strength he had to rise and walk towards the window.  Moving his ear closer to the curtain, the sound gradually got quieter.  He raised both arms slowly and reached towards the torn curtain which separated him from daylight. Life. After yesterday, he realised there was no going back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething stopped him pulling at the curtain.  He sniffed again, never had his senses been so acute.

In his present state of mind, things which he would have noticed before, now ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course there would be changes, but his body wasn’t prepared for what was happening at this present time.  His old life was quickly becoming a thing of the past and he would have to embrace everything opening up, not only to him but everyone around him.  Adjustments were needed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid others feel the same way?  Did they accept the changes without question?  Perhaps the transformation would be different for him.
