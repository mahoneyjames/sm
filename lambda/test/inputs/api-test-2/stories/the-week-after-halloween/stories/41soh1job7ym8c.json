It just didn’t seem fair, it had been so good to be out in the air, wandering the streets. Taking, laughing and most importantly she was there. He could see her, touch her, talk to her.

It was a cliche she’d always enjoyed sticking to. Before they left she had turned to him and said she’d been thinking about him, how she’d watched him for years, nervously trying to approach her, she’d almost done it herself but had always shied away.

He remembered the first time he saw her, there were three of them wandering the moor, a pale blue moon smiling down. But to him only one mattered. Her whirling, dancing, frenzied body. Her raw power and energy transfixing him.

And now from their talks he knew she was a keen gardener, and if there was one thing he knew about it was soil, well, that and waiting. He wriggled again trying to get the itch. 360 days to go he thought and smiled to himself.
