A wave of silence washes outwards, muting all sound; conversation, music, the rattle of money, someone crying, someone singing, someone’s sickly cough, the cry of a croupier, and then further out, engines, gunshots, the sigh of an old man remembering.

Stakes raised. Lives razed. The absence of noise barely noted in the onslaught of every day acoustics.

To most it’s just another show; The 60 seconds of silence. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut some still do. ‘Old, grey eared fools’ as they’re called. In the lonely unwashed fringes of the city they come and gather by the last real tree in the state. Hoping to see one last Cherry appear.  A fruit, bright and beautiful. And though no one remembers the taste anymore, they bring pictures, or draw a Cherry in the dust. If you look closely you may even find a faded X here and there. The tree of course does not bare fruit. But they gather still, to remember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those 60 seconds they can sit in absolute silence and let their thoughts drift back, to that evening when Rylan, the Blossom of Nevada, lit by a single spotlight,  on the final night of his 6000 day run at the Bellagio, in front of the gathered thousands, sang out, one last single pure note, held for 60 seconds, before dissipating, into a shimmer of glitter and fake cherrry blossom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was said to be a performance so beautiful, a final note so distinct and pure and absolute, that no other sound would ever recapture the beauty.  Of his evaporation, some claimed Nevana, others PR, but the great minds of Vegas did not miss a beat and set to work creating the scientific marvel that is the silence clock tower; to honour a moment that could never be recreated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course never is a dirty word in Vegas and honour, just a fallacy. Eventually the 60 seconds of silence became the attraction itself.  Then a nuisance.  Then it was another unnoticed part of the daily routine. A pause in the synthetic symphony, nothing more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, still these many years later, when others have forgotten why the silence sings, and though those that do have been discarded to the small edges; too poor to retire to the coast, to tired of the flash of the lights and the dance of fate, they meet here. A quiet little suburb. Nothing special. With a small garden. Near where a young man from England once came.
