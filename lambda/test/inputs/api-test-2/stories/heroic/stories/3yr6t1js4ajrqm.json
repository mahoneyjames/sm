Eighteen years old and panicking there wasn’t a sick bag in the seat pocket. Or was it at thirteen, when Dad paid close to a hundred pounds for him to fly a Cessna?

It wasn’t finished. From the car on the left jumped a black leather jacket spewing guttural sounds. He slapped his palms on the roof of the red car, and then brought his face down low to stare into the passenger side window. \r\n\r\nSomebody shouted, “Oy!”\r\n\r\nThat was it. Just oy. \r\n\r\nThe beet red animal face turned, showing flared nostrils and lips pulled back from teeth. In a moment it became the face of a man who has just realised he’s stood in the middle of a road with his spittle running down a stranger’s car window. \r\n\r\nAnd just like that, it was over. Both red and black pulled away chastely and he found himself standing alone outside his own car. \r\n\r\nWhat was wrong with people these days? Why the aggro? \r\n\r\nHe got back in his own car. He checked his mirrors – twice – and then pulled away. Roundabout number seven. Middle lane, and then get over to the right, and try, try, try – try not to think about the pregnant wife waiting in the ultrasound room.
