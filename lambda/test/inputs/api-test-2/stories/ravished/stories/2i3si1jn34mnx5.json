They were always sneaking around at work and pretending they were just friends; the build up to this weekend had been intense.  They were finally going to be alone with no interruptions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom dropped Sarah off at the entrance to the Cosy Inn, the excitement within him building until he felt he would burst.  He opened the boot of the car and pulled back the picnic blanket which Sarah had been sprawled across only an hour earlier.  A row of three, shiny knives were neatly lined up.  He had waited a long time for this moment and he wondered if he should take his time with this one, savouring every minute.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuickly he bundled the knives into one of the holdalls and closed the car boot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Tom had suggested taking a walk to explore the grounds. The hotel was in a converted farmhouse and there was nothing else for miles, except for unused barns and stables.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom had carefully selected Sarah as she was exactly like the others.  She was desperate for fun and longed for someone to finally take notice of her.  She was a little mouse of a woman, but that’s how he liked them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What about over there?” Sarah nodded towards the old stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom smiled as Sarah walked on ahead.  After forcing the door open, they made their way inside; luckily the late evening sun allowed them some light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking around the old chairs and shelving covered in dust, Sarah suggested that Tom grab an old dust sheet. He found one covering a large, wooden armchair.  He removed it and placed it down on the cold, concrete floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah smiled.  “Go on then. Lie down.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe looked at her and after some hesitation, he did as she said.  As he lay down on the sheet he watched as she dropped her shoulder bag on the ground and then straddled him. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe reached for his hands and pulled them up above his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Relax. Close your eyes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe reluctantly closed them.  He started to think about later that night.  He always followed the same, simple plan.  Sex. Strangulation. Knife. He tingled with excitement at the thought of her limp body.  As he pictured cutting up her body parts, a sharp object pierced his stomach.  He tried to catch his breath. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes as Sarah plunged the knife deep into his chest.  In her eyes he saw the thrill and intense pleasure of it all.  As he fell away to nothing, Sarah continued to stab away at his body.  She then pushed herself up and looked for the container of petrol she’d hidden earlier amongst the old furniture.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe pulled out a cigarette lighter from her handbag and quickly ran from the stable as it began to blaze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarah had carefully selected Tom as he was exactly like the others.  He was desperate for fun and longed for someone to finally take notice of him.
