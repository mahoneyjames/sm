After she’d wiped the wine from the keyboard she read the message again, but yep, there it was, followed by a winky smiley and a puppy rolling over.

Derek beckoned and Gloria followed, drawn into this grotto where the walls were of wood, dozens of drawers with polished brass handles. Derek scampered to a drawer that was double wide and double height. He staggered under the weight of it as he carried it to one of the tables. \r\n\r\nHe said, ‘I know it’s not really not really the kind of thing you whip out on a first date, but you seemed cool with it…’\r\n\r\nDerek lifted the lid of the box and Gloria peered inside. \r\n\r\nSomething black and sinuous was resting on a bed of red velvet. \r\n\r\nGloria gazed at it. \r\n\r\nShe gazed at it. She gazed at it, and then she gazed at it. \r\n\r\nIt was only the phrase “hello, ambulance.
