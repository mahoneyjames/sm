There were murmurs of discontent from the other grunts as Marvel took the applause and beamed for the flashbulbs.

The scrum he had to face trying to leave the facility, and it was nothing compared to the crowds of people at home, friends and neighbours and all the too busy to smile dog walkers, all of them suddenly wanting to shake the hand that had screwed together the most important ship in the history of science. He turned his car around, parked two blocks away and then crossed seven gardens until he arrived at his own. \r\n\r\nAnother scrum here, around the holoscreen in the lounge. When they saw him they surged his way. Jonesy retreated into his fortress of solitude – his garage. It was home to his pride and joy, a ’38 Lotus two seater he had put together from a kit. It was a mere twenty-seven thousand four hundred and six separate parts, but just to lay his hands on that gleaming bonnet, to feel the chill of the metal.\r\n\r\nCalm slowly returned, his breathing settled.\r\n\r\nWhen there was a discrete tap at the door a few minutes later he was calm enough for it not to startle. It was his wife, and she thrust through a crayon scribble on a piece of paper. It was a stick man lacking in hair with his right hand aloft holding onto a giant screwdriver. \r\n\r\nJones opened the door and let his wife into the garage. She shut the door and then locked it. She faced him, and said, ‘Hey mister, aren’t you the guy who invented the Jones System for Screw Organisation and Delivery?’\r\n\r\nJonesy could only nod.\r\n\r\nHis wife undid her top button. ‘So you’re king of screwing, right?’\r\n\r\nJonesy nodded again. \r\n\r\nHis wife got into the sports guy, and, holding the door open, said, ‘You gonna join me?’\r\n\r\nForty-seven minutes later she had to beg him to stop, but this time it wasn’t old baseball scores that has so effectively staved off the moment, this time it was a rattle, it was a sound from the car that should not have been there. He had put the car together using his system, he had worked out all the kinks in the system on this very car prior to accounting for and screwing in every single one of the forty-seven thousand three hundred and twenty two screws on the test ship.\r\n\r\nJonesy tore through the eighty seven binders till he found the section (suspension, rear, off side), and from there he went to the box sixteen and box ninety-three of the part installation confirmation forms to confirm that – yes – every single part of the suspicion had been fitted. \r\n\r\nAnd yet, there was a noise.
