{"id":"625f211jtvo3bb5","author":"donna","title":"Ernie","content":"Linda could never sleep the night before a holiday. A combination of excitement and nerves invariably led to a night of tossing and turning, constantly tugging at the duvet and readjusting her pillow. Normally Sam got up and moved to the spare room for some peace and quiet. \r\rThis time was the worst ever. Linda lay staring at the ceiling, willing the hours and minutes to pass until morning. On top of the normal concerns about delayed flights and misplaced passports, fretting over whether she’d cancelled the milk or returned her library books, her mind was still reeling from the visit from Mrs Agent that afternoon. ‘For the love of God, let me get some sleep.’ she muttered to herself, but her eyes remained stubbornly open and her mind raced. \r\rA lot was resting on this holiday. After seven years of marriage, the sparkle had definitely dulled between her and Sam, but it was something she was sure could be resurrected by a little escape to the sun. Two weeks in Majorca had worked wonders in the past, and this year would be no exception. \r\rAs a last minute surprise Linda had upgraded their hotel. No more one star Sol De Mallorca for them. Now they would be all inclusive at the Park Hyatt, TripAdvisor's most recommended hotel and spa. Linda could almost taste the Pina Colada, which she was assured by the Thomas Cook website was the best on the island. \r\rShe must have fallen asleep, because the next thing she knew the alarm was blaring. She showered and dressed before dragging the bulging suitcase down the stairs behind her. Sam was sat at the table, still in his pyjamas and staring zombie like at a mug of coffee. She kissed his cheek ‘Come on lazy bones, we’re out of here in half an hour.’ He continued gazing into nothingness, and a weight dropped in Linda’s stomach. Did he know already? ‘Hey, what’s going on?’ the words caught in her throat ‘It’s holiday time, remember?’ she forced a smile. \r\rFinally he looked up at her. ‘Sit down, Linda.’ he said, ‘I need to tell you something.’\r\rShe dropped onto the seat opposite him, impatient at his morose state. ‘What? We really need to get a move on, the flight -’\r\r‘ - I’m not coming’ he interrupted. Linda was sure she hadn’t heard him correctly. Not coming? But it was their holiday. It was the Park Hyatt. Had he found out somehow that she’d upgraded? It was a lot of money, but things were different now …\r\r‘I’m leaving you. I’ve met someone else. I want a divorce.’ \r\r*********************************\r\rThe Pina Colada was even better than she’d hoped, and the view from the suite of the Park Hyatt combined with the fourth cocktail in an hour lent Linda a serene mood, all things considered. Holidaying alone wasn’t so bad after all. And who knew, she might stay longer. Weigh up her options. As Mrs Agent had said only the day before, life changing events had to be well considered, not rushed. Which was why she hadn’t told her soon to be ex-husband about Mrs Agent's visit. She’d never even realised that when you won the Premium Bonds £1 million jackpot they came to tell you in person. And they help you invest it in an anonymous bank account.
