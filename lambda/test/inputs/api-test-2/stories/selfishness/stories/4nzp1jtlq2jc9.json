He asked a black girl how she got time off from the plantation. He said to Xao Li what kind of gap in the door did he manage to slip through?\r\n\r\nHe winked up at the set of Abs stood next to me. He said, ‘Hello little teacup, can I show you my spout?’\r\n\r\nThis guy was one of the Backstreet Boys, low cut vest to show his gym stuffed body and tight jeans to show his sock stuffed pants.

We all piled outside to serenade them out of sight, Corgis still bobbing gently in the breeze above the privet. When the Corgis began to slowly dance the whole of the party cheered and someone called out for Liz to cover her eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was only when the first Corgi drifted free and skyward that we fell silent and we could at last hear the screaming. Carnage waited behind that hedge. Liz wheels up, blood splashed across her canvas, and Phillip down on his knees streaming tears. \r\n\r\n‘Not again, not again,’ he kept saying. \r\n\r\nAbs was flat on his back, moving with tiny moans, hands still curled in useless fists that never stood a chance.  \r\n\r\n ","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MP3FDmRF2Dzzw0FQP816ozymFjtUwMEkTuvmgvjxs5c/edit?usp=drivesdk","order":93,"format":"google","errors":[],"publicId":"ferocious-phillip","html":"<p>Fabulous Phillip turns sexty-nine. </p>\n<p>Be there and be Queer! </p>\n<p>(Fancy dress mandatory)</p>\n<p>We call him Phillip the Greek but he’s as Welsh as a coal miner’s uncle.
