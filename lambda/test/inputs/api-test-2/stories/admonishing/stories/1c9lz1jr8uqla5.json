His mother took his bag off of him and ushered him towards the front door. He glanced back over his shoulder at Alexa unloading the boot and shaking her head.\r\n\r\n'You'll have a leg won't you, of course you will' said James' mother, putting the biggest turkey leg on James' plate. She piled his plate high with roast potatoes, 'triple cooked, just how you like them,' she sang. Alexa raised an eyebrow at him over her 'ladies' portion. \r\n\r\n'Alexa and I are on a bit of a health kick' said James, 'so this is a welcome break.'  \r\n\r\n'Oh you don't want to be bothering with all that nonsense now do you' said his mother, waving her hand dismissively. \r\n\r\n'Not if you like your arteries clogged’ said Alexa under her breath. \r\n\r\n‘Pardon what was that?’ asked James’ mother. \r\n\r\n‘I said yes we’re writing a blog’ said Alexa. \r\n\r\nHis mother frowned, ‘oh yes dear how is life as a travelling cook?’ She asked. \r\n\r\n‘Alexa is an executive chef Mother, she’s requested to cook all over the world, she’s in great demand,’ said James, squeezing Alexa’s hand proudly. \r\n\r\n‘So that’s why I never see you’ harrumphed his mother. \r\n\r\n‘Oh mother’, tsked James with an indulgent smile. \r\n\r\nAlexa breathed in, nostrils flaring. \r\n\r\n‘I’ll go and find a nice bottle of red’, James jumped in, getting up from the table.  As he left the room a stony silence settled. Alexa chopped her potatoes into smaller pieces. \r\n\r\nJames’ mother straightened the napkin next to her plate. \r\n\r\n‘So have you and my son decided when you’re moving back? asked James’ mother. \r\n\r\nAlexa closed her eyes. ‘You should probably ask him about that’ she replied.\r\n\r\n‘Oh I see’, said James’ mother. \r\n\r\n‘What’s that supposed to mean?’ said Alexa putting her knife down. \r\n\r\n‘Well we all know who’s really in the driving seat,’ his mother smiled, then added quietly ‘And I’ve never liked women drivers.’ \r\n\r\nAlexa snapped ‘WHY ARE YOU SUCH A SOUR OLD BAG’. \r\n\r\nJust as the words flew from her mouth James re-entered the room. \r\n\r\n‘Alexa’ he shouted, his voice like a whip. He marched across the room, ‘don’t talk to mother like that!’ James had never admonished Alexa about anything. She felt a moment of remorse as James’ mother’s bottom lip began to tremble, but as James leant over to comfort his mother she shot Alexa a victorious smile over his shoulder. The feeling quickly disappeared.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBS4BaFJsRiGe46klYQ3JjqNDRQpiI2T01Z5ZwAWRko/edit","order":47,"format":"google","errors":[],"publicId":"a-warm-welcome","html":"<p>The curtains twitched as they pulled up to the house.</p>\n<p>&#39;how long do you think she&#39;s been stood at the window&#39; sneered Alexa. </p>\n<p>James sighed, ‘please try to be nice’. </p>\n<p>Before Alexa could respond James’ mother threw open the door and rushed towards the car. </p>\n<p>&#39;Hello hello my boy&#39; she bellowed, &#39;welcome home, come in come in!&#39; His mother took his bag off of him and ushered him towards the front door.
