The stack of gaudy cushions from the sun loungers look like they’d make an inviting bed, but now is not the time for sleeping. Downstairs is beginning to come alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere among the rafters are the treasures. The life once led, but not quite cast aside; the old framed photographs boxed away to make way for the new - a stretch of deserted starlit beach, two cocktails, a shining ring, a baby bump, a gap-toothed smile, a new bundle. A timeline of all the happy moments. All hidden here. Gone but not quite forgotten. Ready, waiting to be collected another day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI watch the amber light fade to grey, to nothing, to blue stillness as night falls outside.

The warmth ebbs, the tapping of the pipes, the settling of the house for sleep as one by one the family settle in for bed. Brushed teeth, soft pyjamas, goodnight kisses. The click of the nightlight. The silence that settles over everything like snowfall, dampening, deepening, darkening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen slowly I move from my place in the dark, open the hatch with a tiny, deafening click and climb down to the house below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M2TKsAU4qofDeLrMvdcojL2-HrjzOCCeEUE-pYtpgvc/edit","order":66,"format":"google","errors":[],"publicId":"upstairs-downstairs","html":"<p>Among the boxes and books, the beams, the balanced photograph albums, the rocking horse covered with a dust sheet, a swirling shaft of amber light pierces the sepia haze and illuminates the spot where I sit.
