Don’t talk when your mother’s talking.\r\n\r\nAnd don’t you touch my Filofax. \r\n\r\nClare found it unguarded on the dining room table and all thoughts of the tea she’d planned were gone from her head. He liked to hug it up to his face, cooing over his precious with its phone numbers and client lists, looking at Mum with those sly eyes all the while. He called her his wilting flower and she lapped it up. \r\n\r\nClare screwed her eyes shut and went into the kitchen by feel. She cut the green tops from the strawberries, washed them and set them in a bowl.

The fridge door went, bottles clinked, and all to the soundtrack of Skull Face whistling. She let the buttons in her hand drop to the floor. Not even chocolate could handle Skull Face in his pants, or less. \r\n\r\nWhen he climbed the stairs he called out - ‘Champagne for the lovers. And strawberries too!’\r\n\r\nClare scattered the chairs as she burst from under the table. Her bowl of strawberries was gone from the kitchen. \r\n\r\nShe raced the stairs and charged her mother’s bedroom, and stopped in the empty doorway. The muffled sound of her mother giggling drifted down the landing. Braced for flight Clare edged closer till her ear was against the bathroom door. \r\n\r\nHer mother giggled some more and then bathwater sloshed. Skull Face ate a strawberry, his voice a honeyed murmur but no words. \r\n\r\nHer mother’s voice said, ‘Where’s mine then?’ \r\n\r\nMore sloshing and Clare backed away, her strawberry loathing mother keen to try one, voice getting more and more urgent as Skull Face held it out of reach. Clare was at the top of the stairs when the strawberry at last arrived amongst a barrage of joy. \r\n\r\nIn the dining room she turned on the lamp, set out her books and stared before opening the Filofax.\r\n\r\nSnug inside a loop of elastic was the very pen he used to write those numbers and names.
