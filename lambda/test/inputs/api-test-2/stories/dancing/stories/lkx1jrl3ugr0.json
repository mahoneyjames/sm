She wasn’t sure if it was the rum or the ceilidh which had done it but she didn’t know which way was up, but then, she wasn’t sure she wanted to.

What if anyone had seen you? What if your MOTHER had seen you’. Since then, the admonishment had come thick and fast; ‘lower your voice, young ladies don’t shout!’, ‘shouldn’t you be sewing’, ‘that is not ladylike’.

Her parents might seem like upstanding and well-bred citizens but she knew about the late night visits from that mysterious beast, Cap’n Mahoney. She knew her father selected the best bits for himself and his family, and she had heard from the stable boy, Lewis, how they’d been begotten, that lad missed nothing. Ah she would miss Lewis. He’d taught her more about what being a ‘lady’ was than her stuffy parents ever could. Her hips bucked all the more vigorously at his memory.

She had managed to convince him not to throw her overboard, however. Her fee? Dancing lessons. It turned out that the Cap’n was a dab hand at ceilidhs but wished to expand his repertoire to include the waltzes recently favoured in the courts.

Helen had pleaded again for her life, saying she was Beth, the stolen daughter of a good Irish family who’d pay good money for her safe return, and had managed to find her way into this Captain’s favours, this time through teaching him the ceilidh moves so spurred by Cap’n Mahoney.
