His mother put a firmer elbow into his back and Harkness found himself plunging into the fray, lacy gloved hands reaching for him, horsey teeth barred in a manner more akin to a French cavalry horse than genteel shire women. \r\n\r\nBloody cousin Archie, the boy a pip-squeak able-seaman, and yet he was moving with grace from each gloved hand to the next, whilst Harkness smiled and tried not to flinch each time something soft and curvaceous made a probing sweep for him. Harkness was a catch – the hero of Cadiz, and heir to ten thousand acres. Oh, to be aboard his ship watching a dozen briney sailors stripped to the waist dance the hornpipe. \r\n\r\nAs the tinkling of the pianoforte faded the sharks began to close, and then! \r\n\r\nA cry rang out, and a murmur of alarm spread. \r\n\r\nThe beast had been spotted. \r\n\r\nHarkness was saved. This beast was the reason he came home, this mysterious creature that had begun to prowl on moonlit nights. He was deaf to mother’s plaintive cries as he marched from the ballroom. \r\n\r\nHe donned his battered naval jacket, shoved a brace of pistols into his belt and then galloped his favourite stallion down to the village. In the square he discovered a dozen cowering militiamen and their sergeant. \r\n\r\nHarkness raised his cutlass above his head. \r\n\r\n‘It’s probably smugglers, and this beast is a distraction to keep the revenue men inside.’\r\n\r\nThe militiamen clutched their muskets nervously. Harkness dismounted, and led the way on foot. They neared the village’s tiny harbour. Figures were moving in the murky light, figures ferrying bundles from the hold of a ship. Harkness surged forward in triumph.\r\n\r\nOne of the militiamen raised a weak hand and pointed.\r\n\r\nIt was the beast.\r\n\r\nThick black hair matted around snarling teeth, with slavering jaws sounding a growl that seemed to dance from hell. The beast’s arms were thick with muscle, its hands shaggy fur and wicked needle-sharp claws. \r\n\r\nIt was the head of a best but the body of a man, and what a man, what a beautiful torso and legs, naked skin so smooth and inviting in the moonlight. Harkness could not tear his eyes away. He stood slowly, fingers picking at the buttons of his coat.\r\n\r\nThe militiamen stared open mouthed at the size of this thing. \r\n\r\nIn an awestruck voice, the militia sergeant tried to buck them up.\r\n\r\n‘Lads, the law of averages says there has to be some _enormous_ outlier.’\r\n\r\nHarkness has removed his shirt too. He stood there, bare chested and magnificent. He gazed at the cowering militiamen. \r\n\r\nHarkness said, ‘That’s no beast, and to prove it, I’ll go one on one until either he’s trapped under my panting body or I beneath his.’\r\n\r\nHe strode out to face the beast.\r\n\r\nThe militia sergeant whistled low. \r\n\r\n‘Lads.
