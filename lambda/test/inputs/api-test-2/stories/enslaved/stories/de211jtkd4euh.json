I’m good thank you, yes, yes.\r\n\r\nNow, first things first. Just to remind you. I’m Julia, your female CEO. Female, as in woman. Female, as in slightly disturbed by your department’s drive to produce a range of female only sex-bots. \r\n\r\nYes, that one. \r\n\r\nYes, I understand you’ve taken my feedback on board, and I’m looking at your response right now. But tell me, when you went ahead and designed a range of male sex-bots, did you – by any chance – talk to any women?\r\n\r\nI see.
