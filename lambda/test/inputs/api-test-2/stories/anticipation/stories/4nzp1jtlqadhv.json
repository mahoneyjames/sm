What we needed was Lenny to claim ownership of the remote. There’d be mutterings, but none to his face, the guy with fingers wide as the remote.

Nine of us guys, and one television set. \r\n\r\nThe best argument two nights ago, Ricky and a filched copy of the Radio Times and a film that “Contains Nudity”. We sat through sixty minutes of Ken Russell’s seminal work, Women in Love, and then I remember chaos, and almost blood. Ricky sitting there oblivious, eyes only for the telly with Oliver Reed and Alan Bates wrestling nude in front of a roaring fire. \r\n\r\nIt was Dunc with a plan for tonight. Dunc was going to bring peace to the centre, an evening of harmony that didn’t end with a misplaced fist sending some poor so back to prison. It was a stupid plan, course it was, Dunc back from the charity shop with a board game. Only child, was it, Dunc?\r\n\r\nBut hey, worth a shot, right? This is why I spent my last three quid on a tray of cupcakes, the kind that are all lurid icing and soft teeth rot. It was the cakes brought them to the table, four guys with hard faces and scarred knuckles munching on E numbers as Dunc set out the board.  \r\n\r\nBenny said he was the car, he was always the car. Luigi said he was always the car too, same with Kenny. Six of us sitting down to play, and five of us always the car. \r\n\r\nDunc said, ‘There is no car. There’s no little dog, no top hat. This isn’t Monopoly. You collect these little plastic counters, see, with the parts of the ant on them? The winner’s the one who gets enough pieces to make the queen.’\r\n\r\nIt was Benny with the snigger, and jerk of his head at Ricky in front of the telly.\r\n\r\n‘We need another?’ \r\n\r\nI’m glad Ricky’s not playing the game. Guy has balls, have to give him that, sat there with lips faintly purple, mascara faintly green. \r\n\r\nSix of us playing in almost harmony, rolling dice, stacking up counters. It’s only a matter of time, an errant roll, a misplaced elbow, and then I’m hitting the floor and staying there. I hope Dunc does the same, leave the rest fight it out. \r\n\r\nAnd then, oh man, the bliss of it. We lose at least two, right? I figure ramming a dice in a guy’s eye puts him in hospital and the rammer in violation of parole. But think about it, four of them go and that remote control is mine. \r\n\r\nIf my luck holds I’ll find a re-run of Women in Love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16P4ZR8fSsX9VoI9t0ZqhAUtv_jUps3lmPfmgA9oZk2k/edit?usp=drivesdk","order":142,"format":"google","errors":[],"publicId":"anticipation","html":"<p>Elbow room, too much to ask?
