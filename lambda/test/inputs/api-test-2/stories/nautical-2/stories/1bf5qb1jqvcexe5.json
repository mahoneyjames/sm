First time his boat ever left the quayside - yet another cunning plan of Mister Oh-so-clever, property prices gone mad but I’m not, so why not a place on the marina for a fraction of the cost? It was the first time she ever ate a steak done sous-vide, pink, moist and juicy, temperature perfectly set by the waterbath so that even a humble self-professed wannabe cook such as him couldn’t muck it up.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time she ever hit a man around the head with a champagne bottle too.\r\n\r\nWas he dead?\r\n\r\nShe thought he was dead. His blue eyes were open, glassy and bold in the moonlight. He was still warm.
