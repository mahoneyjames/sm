I was expecting a bit more of a twist for this one. But it was well written and characters were quite honest. I was jus hoping for something extra at the end.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Love the dynamic here it feels very real. The characters are well developed given the brevity. James’ Mum particularly from the first twitch of the curtain up to the victorious smirk!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Best before</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh I loved this! They remind me of the couple who ran the post office on Crwys road (now an artisan micro-beer pub). The guardian of the curly ended sandwich line was inspired. Liz?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Love the pun here. Clever. There's definitely a great story in here and the description really paints the picture of a grotty reality with its own beauty and affection. I think this could benefit from having the opportunity to be a bit longer  and maybe another few edits to really carve out the nuances of the narrative. She does sound gross, though ;)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I also loved the ending great last line&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Paints some good pictures here. I thought there might have been some romance hinted at here but not sure.  To be honest she sounds gross though.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;The ending made me chuckle - very clever. &lt;br&gt;Some other funny moments which I enjoyed e.g. hatchet faced old bag&lt;br&gt;I like the way the passage of time is portrayed via the switch from pork pies to artisan ciabatta sandwiches&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Something honest</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I am glad that this went full circle, as i didn't buy that she felt bad about what they were doing. I like that she was just a bit bored.  She never cared that they were ripping people off. And even how she would change his 'night' just shows her true character.  Good story though.  Just makes your think people are all bastards.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;i like the way that, as so often happens, we fail to bite the bullet on pursuing ambition replacing with instant gratification! that made me a little sad.   &lt;br&gt;i'd recommend reading twice as first time i didnt quite get it! Very good story though!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I get a real sense of contrition through the first half of this, of someone who realises they're in a morally dubious job and wants to get out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the switch to something more hedonistic towards the end there. If you wanted to the make the pale girl more ruthless one tweak would be to make falafel guy on the fence about clairvoyants, but having recently lost his wife himself he could be swayed. As it's written, the pale girl is getting Madama whatsherface to tell falafel guy that her mate likes him...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Old shocky</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I enjoy how easy it is to hate them. Poor old shocky hey I mean he was just being himself. Well crafted atmosphere nice and believable but also ridiculous story, which is about right!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Very silly, but also miserably true to life... she wasn't sending photos of her genitalia but I did have to wait for someone to finish on her phone recently before she served me in a cafe - her exact words  (after watching her swipe swipe swipe for a few minutes) were 'urgh, Grindr is not being kind to me today'. Though weirdly I just went and doublechecked the spelling on Grindr and it appears it's for gay men, so that makes the whole thing kinda confusing... Maybe it was a poorly thought out cover story and she was texting her Nan... ANYWAY... the comment is now turning into a story. sorry. The lads together thing as Jen noted in nicely done. my preferred reading of the end was that Richie didn't here cos he'd stopped listening to the story a while ago and was already dealing with more 'wench admin' (excellent term by the way, urgh what a douche Richie is!)...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;never having sent a dic pic or heard of one til recently i hadnt considered that they were basically flashing.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Love the idea of this and the tone - the 'all lads together' at the start. Would have liked more comeuppance for Richie - 'gross you're just the same as a gross old park flasher etc.'&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;true, he is a reprehensible character, but i don't think he's quite on par with old Shocky - I mean, if it IS a shag app, and recognised as such by all involved, at least the women he is sending his dick were hoping to see a dick at some point in the near future, whereas no-one walks around the park to get a dick in their face (or that of the infant twins/baby and toddler combo!)&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Also he said he wasn’t sending doc pictures just being upfront so not quite the same. But I get the sentiment. Verbal flasher&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;he was sending a dic pic - just equating it with being upfront&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Manon Boucher</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Really liked the idea of this one, and the little details are nice like the last k if doors. the contrast between careful planning to make deaths appear accidental to what I assume is the butchery of 4 men, one maid then I guess the 4 girls upstairs seemed a bit inconsistent with the character though. I also got a bit confused by the temporality in this, something could have been done to the opening perhaps to make this clearer - I think it’s the ‘tomorrow it’s onto another city’ line, followed by the contexf but then straight into the next victim. Just didn’t quite flow right for me. Might just be me though...!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like the suggestive tone of this - we know that something's going down in the very first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also like the bits about not being seen dead eating her shitty food, but the use of this becomes *too* direct at times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did find it strange that the sexist diner would then hire the female chef though, so I was expecting to find out she was there in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>The cellar</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yeah this is a good one. Proper creepy. Needed to be constant with Abigail not Abi but it flowed very nicely and gave the great image of it could just be Childs fear or it could be something else.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is well put together, all the imagery conjures up the dancers and the teacher and the sense of dread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;lovely line:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;a scraping of black hair and paper-thin white skin stretched taut over brittle bird bones&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;oh my god, this is awesome. So scary. I really enjoyed this story - such a rich, descriptive piece. I agree that it is a Jenny Allan one&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ohhh this is so creepy! Definitely Jen unless someone’s been doing their research! Very vivid - both the disciplinarian nature of the art and the instructor, and the grim creepiness of the cellar. Lots to leave you wanting more too which is always good.  What is the mysterious beast? Can it really be evaded by stillness? Is it even really there or just an overactive imagination?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Dancing queen</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This was a lot of fun. Ended up so far from the start which is great, proper journey but nicely done. Loved the characters. Bizarre beast which I also loved. Just good stuff&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Very good&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Love it. Very funny and swashbuckling. I too am intrigued by what made Harkness seek out the beast - did he know in advance how captivating it was?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;It's turned into a bit of a Bear romp in my head! Great story&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Excellent story! Has someone been listening to Cosmo Jarvis? Does Harkness know already that this beast is such a hottie (from the neck down at least) it or is it just that ANYTHING is better than dancing with women? I hope beastie reciprocates :-)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Dance everybody</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I love how bonkers this is. That Cap'n Mahoney - what a roguish wonderful amazing character!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Who knew we had all these adventures together?!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Lisa from next door</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Good suspense build and the internal monologue/self deprecation thing worked well but I wasn’t actually sure what was happening... I’m kinda horrifically sleep deprived and am more snot than woman at the mo so that’s probably not helping...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like the twist of her scaring him at the end there. The italicised thoughts put me in mind that that she was already tied up in the basement, perhaps foreshadowing some terrible fate he was going to mete out, so to have them be his lustful hope and *her* be the one to turn the tables was good.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Untitled</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I have to admit I got a bit confused by this... understand now thanks to James’ comment but just even knowing that Helen was a hedgehog it doesn’t quite sit right. So he’s been driven mad with grief because his Mrs has run over his hedgehog and is travelling, soaked and filthy, filled with rage, to exact vengeance? He doesn’t seem like a ‘dish served cold’ type - why has he waited until Friday - his invite to games night? Something just didnt feel right with it... though it does feel a lot like he’s been stewing and plotting so maybe he is... sorry this is more of a deliberation on his character than decent feedback, im not quite aure about it and can’t quite put my finger on why! The ‘Scrunched against the carriage side wall like half a mackerel, skinned and boned in a can full of assholes’ line is pure gold though!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I liked this. I thought it was funny, mainly for the vicious bile (almost as though it was written whilst someone was on the train).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's something quite detective noir about bits of it&lt;br&gt; - &quot;like half a mackerel, skiinned and boned in a can of assholes&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's very clever when you realise that Janey ran over a hedgehog in her car, and this is a revenge piece...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I think this is great, livened spectacularly by the written on an iPhone typos! What did aled and kev think of dev’s &lt;b&gt;ejection&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>The happiness you deserve</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is great. I kept expecting something foul to be snuck into Chris’s food but this was much better. Urgh kids can be so revolting.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;So is he gay? Isn’t he? Does it matter? Fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its more of a clod than a clot. Enjoyed it though. Characters develop nicely.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>some conversations</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is great. I like the little vignettes into S's life and how they sum up the casual ways she is shouted down. I hope that one day you write a story when she has enough of their bullshit and hits back. The clots bit at the end is hilarious&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Did S say something sorry I wasn’t listening!!! Very good ,&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Nubtrunk</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;The way you convey the whole story through a one-sided conversation is clever and a good way of making it funny. I would like to have seen more interaction with the robot - there's a lot of potential for hilarity there...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Well it’s great fun. Who cares about the theme. It’s loosely in there, almost as loose as the bubble bath and ballet. Was he head of head of robotics or is she repeating her self?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Funny although I was slightly confused until third reading and  I still don’t get Just how it’s theme is enslaved  .&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yes, the theme is tenuous. If we introduce a scoring system I might lose points for that. The story stems from another piece about a race of enslaved sexbots, only I couldn't do justice to that version before going away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or it's a satire on how those in high level management positions might seem to have power and influence but really they are a slave to the stockholders demanding ever more ridiculous products to satisfy a jaded public.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is hilarious! Good effort whoever wrote this. Love the format as well - and the 90s commercial reference. Top marks for silliness.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>The office manager from hell</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;My favourite this week. Really clever. Loved the juxtaposition of the scenarios and how dirty sniggering at the sleazy fetish makes you feel when you realise part of it has been about the awful treatment of Saeed. Really effective&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Some brilliant vivid descriptions here. I really like the mixture of tones. I just felt a little like the ending was too detached - there needed to be some sort of link between the two, not sure how. I love the contrast of paid for punishment and the idea of real slavey but I don’t know about fields and gang master - maybe it could have been more about modern day slavery that happens in uk. Could have been a neighbour maybe? Slightly more relevant as otherwise it almost seemed a bit too much of a stretch. But great idea and really well written.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;i think i tried not to &quot;attach&quot; place or time to the real slave story so no one would guess til the last minute, gangmasters certainly exist here (that cockle picking disaster in morecambe with chinese immigrants?), the idea of someone being kept in a hutch and working in a field was from something i saw about spanish agriculture but also that guy on the coast road was kept in a very small shed. The bondage story i dont know how realistic a description of what actually happens that was but i guess you get what you pay for and if staple guns are his thing!&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yeah that makes sense. I think my mind just made more of a jump to field slaves etc and a different country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the bondage...of course I wouldn’t know what actually happens either.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Good to see a different approach - clever use of contrasting those who pay for misery with those who have no choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't like the shifts in tone between the bondage guy, and the slave boy. The bondage bits felt too lighthearted, more of a satire on the world of paid for pain, which felt a distraction to the main thrust of the piece&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to confuse things  stylistically ie carry on romp turns dark  which brings some responsibilities to your precise execution to get the tone exactly right, all in all I suspect you are probably correct in that the office manager staple gun stuff is an idea too many&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like the staple bit it fitted well. It’s he sort of thing that definitely happens!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ohhh… This is so dark. Super clever structure, such a nice trick to make the reader feel thoroughly repulsed by the ending. Well done!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Enslaved</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Brutal and honest - really descriptive and you really feel for the character. I'd love to see more stories like this out in the world that show the ups and downs of parenthood - just sharing only the good stuff or only the bad stuff can be really isolating for people and it hides the reality.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This was really well crafted and quite beautiful. It isn’t trying to be anything other than a simple glimpse into the trials of being a mother and the emotion of raising a small human. Loved it and it is clearly close to home. Tender truthful and as james mentioned slightly terrifying but great stuff!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like this , a nice interpretation of the theme&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Excellent invocation of the theme. I don't like the implication of a future this suggests though!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel lethargic just reading about sandy treacle in the eyes&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Number 67</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;in this you manage to do what I always want to do - write a really dreadful character from his own POV without explicitly saying he;s a twat. His actions and thoughts speak for him. Might be more effective still if it was in 1st person?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>A nice weekend break</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;this smacks of Jenny Allan to me! Geoff does seem like a bit of a dick but a sweet one. Lacey got her just desserts I say!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I’m with dan - poor Geoff! Why go away with someone if he does your head in so much? Macey should have stepped up and dumped him instead, though I guess the end passage shows that he didn’t exactly think it was all rosey if his main reaction to his girlfriend electrocuting herself was the enjoyment of the paramedic being nice to him!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Nice use of &quot;shadows walked the room&quot;. &lt;br&gt;Nice and spooky - a ghost that dicks around so people get accidentally electrocuted?&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;So who’s the biggest dick in this? The ghost, Geoff or Macey? Does anybody care about any of them? :)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;A shame for geoff&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;What about Macey???&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Feel it still</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Brilliant. I love the show name - Sing Something Simple. Love the reference to Russ Conway. I often reference him to blank faces. I secretly want to hear this show.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Nice attention to a lot of (I assume!) somewhat niche detail here. Love the idea of the DJ being temporarily possessed by her predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;indeed if you are not around my age or have a ridiculously high interest in old crap and the changing face of british radio deejaying you wont get  a lot of the jokes. i thought of this then just thought &quot;ah sod it&quot; it seves all people under 40 right for making me watch keith lemon once..&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like the attention given over to the replacement song choices. Did Gordon Kaye really release a version of She??? I hope it was in a French accent&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;That's disappointing. Gruber on the piano, general von klinkerhoffen on the bongos.

Am I right in thinking the oy is from him? Taking a heroic stand against black-leather-jacket-dropping-spittle character? Yeah, I like the sort of out-of-body accidental hero thing if this is what’s going on - though putting myself in wife-in-hospital-bed shoes I’d be pretty miffed if this brief display of courage had led to hubby in the next ward rather than holding my hand and stroking my hair!!!&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Spot on. It’s a reflexive oy from someone who thinks he’s timid. I was going for that hero that’s in all of us, even the most wimpy.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ahhh right that makes more sense good spot Hannah. I kinda like that. But didn’t get it I assumed it was someone else saying it.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yes I’m sorry I wasn’t wild about this , i didn’t really understand what the twist said about the man, is he a coward for driving carefully &lt;br&gt;When his wife is giving birth? It just felt a bit disjointed&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Like the start of this - really gets inside the guys head and I can really feel his anxiety and the confusion he feels about it. I'm guessing ti all started when he realised he'd be a dad? Not sure the middle bit about the drivers really fits in the story - it feels like it's disconnected a bit...&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;the pregnancy throws it - it's about irrational fears that seemingly come out of the blue, whereas fears over a pregnancy would be a natural thing. damn the curse of the 3 things!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Shiver, ....me kinders</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Very silly and agree the old-school/contemporary mixes well. Preferred the first outing of these characters though. Oh and Salterton definitely drew the short straw! Ha ha!&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yes it’s not as good as that one&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Great to see some old familiar faces back in this!

Hpe to see more of their adventures in future stories :)&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I was very tempted by the latest twords which suit the new parrot I have in mind but I want to leave the pirates for a few weeks&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Fun! I think we know where the Bob Monkhouse Puntasm award is heading for this week...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little bit more formatting in paragraph one would help - I missed the introduction of Salterton and spent the first read thinking that Fakebeard was undergoing some gender uncertainty issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the blend of modern day with old school pirating action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure you can actually get pregnant from taking it up the spinakker though.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Diamonds are for Emma</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This was fun. The comedy docking and going to town on Lady Susan was funny but did jar a little as I don’t think it was as funny as perhaps it was intended. Not in a bad way. But I kind of found it a bit sad rather than ridiculous if that makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like the idea - a dwarf taking to the skies so they no longer feel out of place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gags were shoe horned in just to get the Jane austen theme kind of barely met!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I loved this - absolute genius! Dan the school kids were her circus pals in disguise! I’m usually easily confused but totally got this. Some lovely lines and well structured - the alternation between narrative and context is very smooth and well balanced&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Love the ending, the tone, the idea and the austenesque puns. There are tipos and words astray in the middle I think which makes it hard to follow the plot and I’m a bit confused between the circus dwarves the children fighting etc perhaps I’ve misunderstood. One of those could be brill but might have needed better editing?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Beebland</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ha ha very funny and clever. The poldark paragraph has an amusing typo, unless smuggling is the new spooning. Glad he got his gal in the end.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Deliberate pun on “snuggling “&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Very clever, bravo!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Bride Unprejudiced</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is an absolute corker - the names are ridiculously funny and the plot is wonderful. Nice tone and language. I love how in the moment it all is too. Too marks to the mystery author (jenny?)&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Twas I! well done!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Haha love it!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Late</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This felt very autobiographical to me? I loved the first two thirds and I can totally see the reality of her death, but the ending felt possibly bit rushed. It jumped from her being dead at bottom stairs and then him sat around for an hour. I wonder if it had hit him after ambulance had left or something like that it would have made more sense. Just seemed like a bit was missing in that end scene build up. But genuinely really enjoyed it! Loved the opening style and possibly could have had more taking direct to the reader throughout, as it seemed to transition more into normal narrative after first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Really good. The opening paragraph sets the tone nicely - slightly wry, slightly biting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I particularly like the bit about the old man crying salty tears into his salty herring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clare's ending fits in perfectly with her flustered life&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is totally how I see myself dying...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Godfrey the Great</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like this - it's super intriguing, though I am a bit confused about what's going on. I thought it was a battle camp, but maybe everyone got kidnapped and Godfrey was too late to save them? This could be Beth - it's very Robin Hobbish&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;From the title I thought this was going to be a revisit to one of James crazy worlds, but this was very intriguing. I just assumed they were moving army and he’d been left behind,&lt;br&gt;But the end gave it a very different twist and now I just don’t know anything any more! Well put together though. Why was he so tense. What were the warning signs he was expecting about? So many questions.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh I love this! Feels a bit Hobbesian! Poor Godfrey his whole life has been waiting for this dubious joy and he has clearly failed most completely. The scene is beautifully set - though I’m also not sure who the figure is. Cool? Mourning she’ll have no one to cook for? Or death, as James suggests?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Hmm, what's going on? I thought Godfrey had overslept through a battle, but then why would cook be at the battle? So a Marie Celeste type thing, or is this lone figure Death, come to claim his soul?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's well put together, the whole piece flows - nicely done&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Great pies a-flyin</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Loved this one. Beautifully written. Very simple story but shows the mindframe&lt;br&gt;Of the smallest thing that can send someone over the edge. Really powerful moments. Love the cosy red line. What was she cooking that had actual beaks in? Was she just cooking chickens whole unplucked? If so I love it. Real mental health focus or someone so lovingly preparing a meal that was not quite right. My fav this week.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;lol, you get little china birds to put in pies to let the steam out of the pastry top...&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;There's a little china bird in the pie to do just this. &lt;br&gt;There's also a chicken run in the back garden full of living chickens, some of whom do get covered in red hot gravy for comic effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm sure the anonymous author of this piece bitterly regrets not editing that line out at the same time as the bit about the chicken run...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh that makes more sense now...&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I prefer it when she’s mad and cooking whole birds though :)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;OH wow this is poignant! Poor crazy mother - the passage where she is imagining them dying is so upsetting - that kind of miserable mind spiral of someone who spends too much time in their own head. And of course poor chicken - if the dish burnt her fingers I dread to think what the gravy did to the bird! Nice use of the things and a sweet (maybe too sweet? No, just right) ending.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>In an instant</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is sweet. The formatting makes you read it all in a big jumbled rush, which is exactly how our character is thinking. It's also somehow really visual without being overly descriptive. I think it's probably a Lewis Gwyther original...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Charming's the perfect word for it - poor old Mr Herb Garden (though I did keep expecting a euphemism to pop in there at some point!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect kind of monologue to be set to an animated Plasticine porcupine talking about gas bills.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh this is charming - I love the tone and the asides and the great big in-indented chunk of textiness which so perfectly represents a rambling internal monologue. I hope she gets to him in time!!!&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Joke's on me. Right then, couldn't take the time to format it, could you? I'll post it as is then, ha ha!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out it's an artistic decision...&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Well artistic decisions can be based on laziness...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Photographic memory</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh this is so sad. I liked that you kept up the mirage right to the end. Poor Ruth, of course, maybe she is the real victim here, at least Mum can hide in her delusions. Urgh it really is the saddest end 😢 beautifully done.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Jen?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Dive right in</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;&quot;she's showing you her business&quot;!!  lol&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ha I like&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Tears of a clown</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yeah really good feeling of melancholy - the self criticism was maybe a little overplayed, but I get that's building into the melancholy theme. There's definitely a strong story and some emotive ideas here, but maybe worth revisiting sometime for a bit of editing, or even expanding into something longer and more detailed&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I liked this but it took a few reads as it’s quite conplex - lot of characters that I don’t know if they’re real or not, and locations that needed careful reading to place. But I like the depressing ending. Made me smile. Not sure about the introduction of the son and then nothing. Could have come back to him maybe? Also who was the unsavoury stranger? But overall I liked the rambling style.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Dudley Sutton was the stranger having seen him naked it is quite unsavoury. Yes as Hannah says it’s a good idea and I got a feel out but it needed a lot of work, the mix of names were part real part made up really just to keep it vague. Like looking at a playbill with some names you’ve never heard&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Definitely a downbeat feel to this, but I don't get all the self criticism. It might need a touch of polish, but it works nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;The idea is good but the writing doesn’t always flow that well - feels like it needed a bit more editorial attention. Just a few mistypes and odd punctuation getting in the way of a smooth read. Loved the phrasing in line about them pissing in the mud, this felt really polished and sharp, whereas other bits seemed a bit more rushed maybe&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Hands up I felt itimportant to put something in and didn’t don’t have time to edit at all sorry !

You think it’s heading for dismemberment, but it turns out a friend is just an unsavoury stranger you haven’t met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice one&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Well I hoped this would end nicely. Otherwise Jesus that’s bleak. Well written and good balance. But yeah stop count down skipped -  maybe word count? Lovejoy was bit rammed in there but that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like this, I can’t say/ don’t know anything about structures and shit sorry but i didn’t have to be aware it was being written&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Love this one - some really emotive phrases, particularly the warm banality and the sound of the bus pulling off. I liked the use of the counting down stops though wondered why ‘one stop’ was missed - just seemed like a nice structuring device so was in intentionally excluded or was she too distracted by the assumed perv to keep counting down. The suspense is well built and the twist is nicely executed.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Her mistake</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Horrified-face&lt;br&gt;It’s well done. I like the counterpoint to the previous story.&lt;br&gt;She’s unsavoury because her flat is so caked in cat hair that a man can spot them without dropping to his hands and knees.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Sad now&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I knew it. Almost commented on the last story saying yeah be he kills and eats her now yeah? You bastards. Or bastard? Either collusion or dual wielding but either way it is very mean.  Technically she wasn’t an unsavoury stranger and it didn’t seem very bloody melancholic to me. Seemed like he was just a meany being mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why I don’t do buses!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh  ......preferred the other one that didn’t end like this.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Not Cos it’s not good and clever but Cos I wanted trust to be rewarded.

Whether she actually believes he is watching lovejoy in heaven or not is irrelevant I guess, but there’s something very sad and touching about maintaining the rituals of togetherness even after death.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>sigh, another kick in the teeth</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh so sad and pathetic. I like the line about the jumper unravelling onthe nail of life.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is a great peek into someone's life. Love the raising of hope at the end and then the brutal, inevitable feeling dashing of it. Think we've all had that happen to s at some point!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Perfect for the 500 format! A nice little story of a moment&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is very true. Especially the punchline. I have been this story.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Parrot in carrot</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is def my favourite in this week's theme. Made me properly laugh out loud. Don't change any of it!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I love this. Hilarious :-) my favourite in this theme.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I can do nothing but admire someone who takes on the use of a 8 word character name and yet still has time for events to happen, a wide range of pirate description intricacies and vivid great tasting food.  Also learnt some new terms such as Doubloon and frogging.  So overall it was great.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is wonderful, a jolly romp of ridiculousness! Particularly liked ‘fake beard the female pirate’ and thought that the way it combines classic pirate stereotypes with contemporary lashings like the sail-thru, complete with Americanised spelling was masterfully managed.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I love the use of Captain's underpants. My favourite bit is the parrot shrieking his food order instead of pieces of eight!&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I agree, that did make me chuckle&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>The prince and the pauper</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Distinctive Jen style. I like the mind wandering. What a bore!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I really like the interspersing of internal dialogue, it worked really well. I kind of wish he had come to a worse end though rather than just her leaving, some sort of more abrupt embarrassment or possibly even physical pain would have been nice.  I did struggle with the use of Prole, that may have been a touch too far. But i loved the pure assholeness of him.  She could have maybe said the goodbye dialogue and then got in the car and said the McDonald line as she was leaving as i got a bit confused at the end as to who she was talking too.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Wow he sounds like a catch! Jenny this stinks of you :-) in a good way. The interspersing of her mental distraction technique with the narrative and his vomit-worthy dialogue works really well after a scene well set, nice job.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;ahahaha that's a great way to put it :D well guessed though Han!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;That Jenny stink gets everywhere&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;ha good juxtaposition of the word estate!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Sous-vide style</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yeah great story, lots of depth and background in a really short space of time. Was confused about Cal and what he is. I assume imaginary friend though. Could make this clearer by maybe describing a situation that its impossible for another person to be with her in, but yet he's there - if that makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Definitely rather dark ...with the possibility of being even darker!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;i'm a bit lost at whats going on throughout here, but its quite menacing.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Now this was interesting.  Very different, and nice and dark.  I wanna say maybe Cal is a dead brother as well, i think that's a good shout by Hannah.  Just a good all round scene, leaves you wanting to know more.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I liked this, it’s dark. The switch from what seems a fairly light opening to a pretty grim story works really well. I want to know more about Cal, imaginary childhood friend, her conscience, her dead brother? Can’t quite place him, though it doesn’t actually matter to the story!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>A new voyage</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is really sad. I quite like how the two halves of the story juxtapose - silly to very dark in a few sentences&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Really enjoyed this. I'm sure he deserved the nickname and lifetime ban but somehow I feel sorry for him!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Nice way to get into Captain Underpants as well!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I really like the first half of this - the surreal world of this sailor chap clinging to his former life by mounting a sail to his car and using the windscreen washer to simulate ocean spray is inspired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, the change tone in the second half is too abrupt, losing that lovely silly edge. I think it would work better if the cop's prejudice was equally surreal e.g. her little brother was run over by a runaway &lt;a href=&quot;https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDuck_tour%3AyF02baYT6QnbxgYoOdST6bncQmU&amp;amp;cuid=5601311&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; title=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_tour&quot;&gt;duck boat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I do like the idea of a runaway duck boat.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like this a lot, I’m full of empathy for the land sailor!! Very well written.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>#newbeginnings</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ha this is super cynical and hilarious. I like your dry take on the difference between a) the lives people lead, b) the lives they want to lead and c) the lives they convince other people that they actually are leading. Esp. like the ‘crema’ filter detail! I thought the three sections hung together a little awkwardly - with all the dialogue in the first bit, then switching to past and then back to present. It might work if you either smoothed that out or made the differences more deliberately definite, so it’s a feature, if that makes sense? At first I thought Heather was leading a meditation class when she was interrupted, which would also have been awkwardly fun&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like the meditation class idea - maybe she's running it over facebook live and gets busted to all her subscribers!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I do like the whole pastures new turn out to be a bit shit theme of the piece, and I especially like the comment on the falseness of social media posturing at the end there!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Oreo</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Well that’s sad. Loved it seeing it from Oreos perspective, really simple idea but just makes it a much more interesting read. Loved the reoccurring smell issues, weak confused pungent hehe.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This reminds me so much of a Paul Auster book called Timbuktu, which I love. If you haven’t read it I think you’ll like it. I really like the switch in perspective that let us into the whole picture and revealed how clueless poor Oreo was to his fate. I think more clarity around Sarah’s character might have been interesting, and the relationship between her and Molly - was it a little resentful on either or both sides? I guess you’d need longer than 500 words to accomplish that! I think you got a lot of emotion and detail in a really short story :)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like the new beginning for Sarah mirrored with the end of things for Oreo. I was a little confused in the beginning with switch between Sarah and Molly. The emotional impact of a dog being put to sleep was diluted because clearly Oreo was on his last legs. Now if he was an oldie but with a couple of more years left...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Smut</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This was terrible&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a69324dad364eb3c89fcc227cd0c8684e58a8c663bb9ef61fc89477f1b2a6644.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot; title=&quot;https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a69324dad364eb3c89fcc227cd0c8684e58a8c663bb9ef61fc89477f1b2a6644.jpg&quot;&gt;https://uploads.disquscdn.c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Very weird. I like the stallion’s penis turning out to be an actual stallion’s penis, but I’m not sure I bought Gloria’s reaction. After so much online dating she must have experienced a fair few weirdos and I think she’d either be nonplussed at such oddness OR she’d love it and ask to sample each one in turn and they’d end up living happily ever after in the garage. I liked how the conversation with her sister gave us more insight into Gloria’s past and her chara&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;And embracing his oddness would meet the new beginnings theme a bit better - a change from the past when she had always used to run from the weirdos&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I will confess that this week's story was all about the jokes - I liked the catatonic shock bit so I never put any effort into thinking about whether that was the right kind of reaction for Gloria.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Tom's new start</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Nice, very moody. Like the line about towers of old boxes being old buildings in a ruined city. The puppy reference felt shoe horned in, though easily solved if it reminds Tom of the noise his puppy once made when it got wedged in behind the sofa...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Who is she? Or everyone loves a box of puppies.</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Clever and very dark but also super confusing! I think I got it, but there’s too much uncertainty at the beginning which made me feel like I was missing something. I like the She is the cat’s mother thing and the idea of a conspiracy of dogs being overturned by cats using their love and stupidity against them (quid pro quo for what they did to humans, maybe?). With a little reworking, and maybe letting it get a bit longer, this could be really excellent and funny too, but it feels like a first draft&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I did not pick up on the cat's mother joke.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I've now looked up where &quot;the cat's mother&quot; bit comes from. That was never a thing in my family. Obviously when we were growing up we always referred to mother as &quot;one's mater&quot;. Perhaps that's a Newport thing&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This was a two read head scratcher. I read somewhere to avoid having two characters with similar sounding names, and I reckon that goes for naming characters after personal pronouns as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that being said, I enjoyed the themes of dogs ruling the world using mind control transmitted through their leads, and the idea of a cat uprising. The second half of the story worked better for me because I'd worked out what was happening by then.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>The Beast Slayer's Apprentice</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I can’t quite express how much this delighted me! Can I forward the story (not the link just the text) to a friend - a dear, spider loving friend? The only phrase ‘on the cusp of graduation from imbecile to full oafhood‘ is just perfect, and of course he is called Geoffrey - admittedly spelt differently but brings to mind another reprehensible and perverse young man who died a horrible death. Reckoning this might be James?&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;You reckon well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me come up with a friendlier url - I'll email it to you. I don't see any reason not to share the link with people, no one seems to have any objections to having their work up here.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Also the individual page link won’t get them to any other stories as this point anyway :)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;ha ha, brilliant! What a scene. I think this has all the hall marks of James' hand.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Excellent. I love the voice of the introduction and how it starts out as if it's one story and then becomes something totally unexpected. Bravo. I got that it was a beast, but it could have been more explicit or more descriptive - like the blurred lines between the erotic and the monstrous!&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to see the beastmaster as a reoccurring tiny character in other stories. This would make me happy.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Filly as in upper class toff talking about women as though they're horses and probably inspired by Jeeves and Wooster, but he may well have had a thing for horses too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beast in this case came with eight legs which it used to entice in the style of an arachnid psiren...&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I assumed you meant woman, but there was part of my that was just thinking, maybe this guy is actually into horses.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I got confused about the legs. Filly as in horse or lady?  Was the guy randy for horses or were they meant to be ladies legs?  I liked the start though, set the scene nicely and enjoyed the ending. It was fun, enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Fire in the night</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I loved this entry, the scene was really well set - I could see it all perfectly, and the period felt really consistent too across dialogue, character names, setting and actions (stealing lumps of cheese etc). The passage just after Mrs Miller discovered the body was particularly well done - ‘Their mounting hubbub mingled with Betty’s screams and the pounding of her own frantic heart‘ really captures that horrible feeling of everything falling apart and noises mingling into an incomprehensible chaos. Only criticism from me is the ending. It just felt like it didn’t need to be there, and the dialogue felt a bit cliche. Maybe it should have ended with the frantic heart? I just didn’t feel that it added much (except the necessary inclusion of pyjamas but given the plot an earlier appearance could have been made)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh and this feels like a Jen to me, gotta a Hobbsy undertone to it :-)&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I agree with the ending. It probably would have been a better story if it wasnt a poirot setup. But also kinda loved that it was.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;What a great few beginning lines. Though the hand tightening in a fist of frustration made me think of the baddie out of Inspector Gadget! Next time Gadget...&lt;br&gt;I though it cut quite quickly to the part where the fire was out after such a lovely rich description at the start. Then the pace seemed to ramp up again. Clearly a Hercule Poirot inspired story and for that reason, I chose Jennifer Allan Poe!&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Instantly knew it had to be Jenny as well. As soon as the end scene began there was only ever going to be one person who wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Love the idea that his craving for cheese saved everyone. This was very descriptive painted great picture with few words, such as snaffling which is always an amazing word to get in. Did not envision poirot rocking up. Loved that as well. Quite a lot of characters with mutiple sons and Betty so got bit confused maybe could have been simplified but I guess that’s the poirot setup you need lots of people running around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the cheese was a double bluff and this was jen :)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Love it! Love me a bit of Captain Hastings!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>The thrill of the kill</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Love the twist in this, switching between the two at the start worked brilliantly to make Sarah seem the innocent (well, perhaps not sexually so, but certainly innocent of being a violent killer) the repetition of their selection process at the end works really well too! It feels quite light which I actually quite like - just seen Liz’s comment below and think of killing Eve it’s got that same kind of silliness to it. In fact there are other similarities which would be total spoilers so I wonder if the author has been watching it too... I don’t know who it is though without revising my earlier guesses.... it feels a bit like a Jenny but I could have sworn the fire in the night was hers... so...pass&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I felt this was a neat little scene that was set but maybe there could have been a bit more in there? Maybe not. Maybe that's all that was needed? A bit more tension perhaps. I'm writing in weird senteces now. Having just watched Killing Eve, this would have been a great story to add a bit more of their twisted characters. Hannah, was this you?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Love the twist on this and the way it makes you question your assumptions. I think you could have dispensed with some preamble and been inside both of their heads a bit more. It's enough to know they've been cultivating this relationship for a while. The last line is great, really cutting and a big 'fuck you' to creepy Tom. More darkness please!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yeah this was fun, love the idea of two serial killers dating. Thought she might have been going for revenge kill, but liked that she was just another crazy. I’d have liked a bit more graphic descriptions during the killing (but that’s just me) cutting up body parts could have been more visual, and the pacing for was very quick at the end (maybe a word count thing?) but some great lines like fell away into nothing, loved that.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Dark. I really like the mirroring of the two characters, and the twist in convention that sees the man ending up as the murder victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found the switch in point of view character from paragraph to paragraph jarring though - I think this could lose that opening paragraph where Sarah can't wait to spend time with Tom and not lose anything from the story.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I agree with the opening bit. It doesn’t quite fit with Sarah - maybe Tom could have been thinking that she was thinking that. For me it was the two nights because she knew she was going to kill him straightaway right?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>The Last</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;So I realise now after rereading this that I again edited out loads of context - I keep doing this. I was going for a rather dark child sexploitation thing and she was basically being sold to a group of men (or that was what was implied). (I know pretty depressing) but re-reading it I did not really get any of that. I keep having ideas in my head that I want to subtly reference but never quite manage it. Hard line between obvious and subtly in such short word count. Ah well, overall fairly happy. Thanks for feedback :)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Urgh what did Amir DO? Or not do, I guess? The description of the slit throat was particularly excellent ‘A half smile across his face, blank staring eyes, a second smile across his throat wide open and dripping.’ and I liked the transition from slightly smug at the start to completely terrified at the end. Indeed throughout I felt that the vibe was really clear, smug - nervous - terrified - almost resigned - remorseful - terrified. Maybe Helen?? Not sure...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Lovely description of the location. I really liked the story and am left wondering about who they were and what on earth had forced her to change into a crazy person. I tend to agree with Jenny's feedback about he 'he thought' bits. Would be a smother read without. I think this might have been Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;You could be a little less explicit with the 'he thought' bits - we'll know when he's thinking if you just put his thoughts in 1st person in the 3rd person narrative and it'll break up the flow less. The atmosphere is really great - I like how it's ust a glimpse at one section of a much bigger narrative - I'd like to know more about these characters and what they've been through. In this we feel sympathy with Amir but it'd be great to read more in another installment when we find out he deserved it after all...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Trip trap</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Sad that people probably dont notice when homeless actually disappear.  I don't think you needed to say trolls lair. I think it would have been better left unspecific and up to the imagination.  Good characters though, Joe seemed like an interesting person - i would have liked to hear a bit more about the stories he told - short snippet maybe?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Breadcrumbs</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is very intriguing and sinister.  But i really want to know more.  Can you send me the longer version?  Really well written and i want more.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Vert dark. Would have liked a twist where we find out it's not the bf down there after all..&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;funny you should say that. there is a longer version...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Upstairs downstairs</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Enjoyed this one too. Love the passage of time. It plays out well. I assume he’s about to murder them all? That seems to be standard fare these days :)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;No but really, it’s beautiful. So atmospheric and really leaves you wondering. I think it’s a burgler, which is a nice twist on where I started (maybe an uncle? Grandparent? Definitely assumed a peripheral member of the household anyway)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I agree with James&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I agree with Dan.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;That is the laziest feedback I’ve ever seen!&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yep&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;i think this is a very beautiful well paced piece. There is a lovely mystery about who &quot;i&quot; is.  Burglar, ghost, momentarily forgotten child,  the mystery is part of the beautiful picture and changes the story in each light.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>The mystery of the sea</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yes agree it has a great rhythm to it. Always tricky to tell a good story in this style but you definitely get the bitter sweet relationship of the two. And I like that the hermit comes across as quite selfish, just using the room when he wants for good night sleep. You get the feeling he doesn’t really care for his daughter but is too wrapped up in his own importance of being a hermit.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I agree with Hannah&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh this is so wonderful. I love the semi structured rhyming and inconsistent verse of it - it’s beautifully poetic without being at all pretentious or seeming contrived. Really lovely.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>One last naked game</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Some beautiful moments and descriptions here. I love the simplicity of the blending in with the grit. There is a deep dark that lurks throughout the whole piece before engulfing us in the final scene. Very good!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;God this is horrible. It’s so bleak and dark and sad and just...horrible. Hats off. Sorry so late to feed back.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Very sad angry and well written.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Death in the Darkness</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Very good.&lt;br&gt;A couple of words took me out of the story - bonhomie and avaricious eyes - they didn't seem to mesh with the tone of the piece, which is stripped back, gritty&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ooo a nice bit of scandi noir. As soon as anyone has lank hair i assume they are evil.  Loads going on in this which was fun, nice to have a packed story, and definitely dark. It was a nice way of drawing you in.  Good research evidenced by the under 20's rule and use of names etc.  Always good to see.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I love this, so so much going on for such a short story. It really has a lot of depth and intrigue to it and left me wanting more. Inspired by the killing by any chance? She’s definitely wearing a semi festive jumper in my imagination&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;yup totally Killing inspired. Also Trapped, which is Icelandic and excellent...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Now you don't see me</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Well this was something completely different.  Loved it.  Was he physically plugging into the device?  It is futuristic?  Who knows.  Loved the concept and the idea you always wake up facing the sun.  Some mysterious illness that is someday going to spread and take over the world. My only concern was that if his life down there was so great why was he in pain?  Surely iceland would be a better option?  That was a bit unclear.  Loved the idea of the family doing what they can to give their daughter some hope.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>walking weekend</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like it. Not big on the world of rhyme in general, but this works nicely.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This feels like its very close to home.  Good use of the poetic, it wanders in its form but i think that's ok, it works with the nighttime trail of thought concept. I love the contrast of the fast years and slow seconds and the use of the fitbit to punctuate the process.  Very good. Bravo.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Love in the dark</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;The switch in points of view between the characters with no indication apart from a new paragraphs works well. &lt;br&gt;Nice way to tell a tale, amusing too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So she fell off the path while taking a photo?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Sad!! Really good way to convey the intimate dynamics of a relationship that don't often get seen by people outside of it. Like how you used the dark theme - her bringing the light to him. Very sweet.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Nice and sad ! I love the juxtaposition of the two characters and their battered but enduring love. Very moving&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>All that jazz</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I loved the first paragraph, ‘she unfurled a baton of vibrant red from its tubular container’ is an excellent bit of imagery, and the description of Dorothea is wonderful. I didn’t feel like I knew what was happening at the end though - it felt like they were the show, and the stage was for them, but then Al’s ‘you made it along’ confused me, but then, I’m easily confused.... Agree with Jenny that’s Dorothea stinks of Liz though not sure why!!!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;So a few things on this one I really liked the great descriptions, it was defitnely on theme and clearly knew the era. I felt like i was supposed to know something more? But I don’t think I got the hints. It felt like a description of a very famous scene (or something before a famous scene) but I didn’t know what that was. If that makes sense. As if you were writing about people who were famous and we were guessing who they were. Don’t know if that’s useful feedback or not :)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Simply the use of the name Dorothea makes me think this is from Liz. I love how you've established some interesting characters - I want to know more about Dorothea's flit from her parents house and more about her adventures. I could see her story as an episodic magazine series. Is that Al Capone at the end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice glimpse into a bigger story. I'd like to read the rest of it!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I can't find seagull, prowler or poison, but I'm willing to accept that a Gin Rickey might well be all three...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;So that's why Sam Beckett never got home! Al was too busy hanging around with flapper girls!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice nod to Mr Capone at the end there :-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You showed me a slice of twenties Chicago, and the lives of the girls getting ready put me in mind of some of the O. Henry stories , featuring a cast of similar young ladies living together in their single room at the boarding house.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>The jazz age (1)</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh, I really like this one! The complete failure of old married couples to communicate is a constant source of amusement and fear for me. Good use of the things as well - liked the recurring seagulls too. The patient mediator of unspecified gender makes a nice narrator. Hmmm... who is the author? Helen?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Nice twist on the theme. I like that he was doing it all for her but part of me also wanted him to be rebelling and creating an awsome speakeasy in his garage. Feel like you could have done more with the bloke we saw doing it on the telly? Maybe he was doing it on the computer? And she could have looked mortified and then explanation. But I liked it.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ah I really liked this. Gentle and daft. I can also see how one might think that anyone who plays the sax looks exceptionally cool (and not work in an office most of the week). Finding it hard to guess this one but going to go for Jenny.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Two mentions of tea defitnely puts jenny in the running!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This fun, and silly, I liked it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to explain what syncopation is, for those of us who don't kiss the brass on the regular - for heaven's sake! he exploded, it's a breathing technique etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the take on the jazz age, the last of the summer wine non traditional growing old. It's also sweet how he's prepared to sacrifice his watching of the seagulls for his wife...&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Kiss the brass on the regular !&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>The jazz age (2)</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;My instinct with anyone over 100 is that they have to die in a spectacular way so I’m glad he didn’t just die slowly on the bench. But part of me wanted him to have a bit more of a fuck you about it. Like he Facebook lives him walking off the peer. But just sad to think how old the jazz era greats are. Paints a good melancholic picture and some really nice phrases. The only question is why now? What’s pushed him over the edge today?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh I think this was from Donna :)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;The mood was conjured up really well here. Love the bleakness of the seaside setting and the contrasts between present day life and how Ken remembered it. I also like that the stuff from the past isn't all rose tinted and nostalgic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think some of the prose could be tightened up to make it more hard hitting and poignant, especially towards the start. The end really took me by surprise and I love that he walks away and leaves the best thing left in his life for a stranger to find. It really hammers home his loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>liz</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;sad times! I didn't get the feeling Ken was the kind to take a long walk off a short pier but then again, I am not 112! I like the way the contrast between his youth and modern life was neatly conveyed by the runner. I am thinking this might be one form Donna.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;A well done vignette of a life lived well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't think you need that shock ending, it's enough for me that he's carried this instrument around all his life and now by giving it up he's giving up that part of his life as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A last day grey at the seaside is what this conjured up for me, and it did it well.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Johnny submit lately</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Oh dear god this is a complete farce! I love it. Playing ‘the’ jazz made me chuckle, as did the monty python inspired threats, just ludicrous. James? Or jenny...?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;What I like about this and I mean it in a good way is that it reminds me of something I would have written as an 11 year old.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I’ve read one sentence and I’m saying James wrote this&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;WTF?! I definitely lolled reading this but I'm so confused! I like that you verbed monologue. Very absurd and totally batshit (seagullshit?) mental. A particular favourite moment is the way in which Leslie maneuvers himself to look at the window.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is bonkers, clearly the work of a deranged mind, but faintly hilarious nonetheless. Quite twisted and dark, and somewhat tenuous in its use of the theme&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>The Grimethorpe Colliery Banned</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Excellent punnage in the title! Glenn Miller was as more swing/big band than Jazz, wasn’t he? I liked the idea and thought the story was great but something gave the game away too soon that the miscreant behaviour was an indulgence in the wrong genre.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;everything's a saxaphone to me&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Loved this one. Great use of prowler in particular.  But mainly I applaud the image of a bright eyed young chap embracing tradition. No idea who wrote it though. But where did Nana go? Was she just not in the room? She just disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Nana turned 100 just as she threw the young lad into the adjustment centre so she ran down the steps and hurled herself from the nearest pier onto a young couple honeymooning on the rocks below.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;112&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Wasn't 100 Lewis's cut off?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Excellent title pun and nice subversion of our expectations here. Also excellent use of the prowler idea. Could have stood a touch more insinuation that Glenn was up to something sexy with another boy in the music room, rather than playing music toward the start and then that could have been blown (arf) when we hear about Dad Colin and Dad Jace.. I like the fast pace of this one :) I suspect James.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I applaud the pun in the title, sir or madam.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>The Blossom of Nevada</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Love the raised/raised thing. Very visual and reminded me of David Mitchell stories&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>helen</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I love how it's written. As Dan said very poetic and I loved the descriptive words. Very clever.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Thats beautifully written. a wonderful poetry.&lt;br&gt;PS its &quot;bear&quot; in all cases apart from nakedness sorry to be pedantic.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Suburban Flight</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Also What is the teeth of Rylan? :)&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;rylan Clark is a celebrity/ reality tv star with extremely white teeth.  one of the three words to be included, so it was necessary to reference him.  He represents as much as anyone a kind of new world, new money working class made good. he is famous  for being famous, has an orange fake tan, extremely white teeth, and once was in a doc by grayson perry saying he'd re invented himself so much that he couldnt remember who he really was anymore. In this way he resonates with the setting (a hair salon) and becomes a flag the hairdresser character unfurls in her loud proud assertion of herself, though this is revealed later to be a brittle front to her true insecurity .     &lt;br&gt;Incidentally whenever i see Rylan on telly or hear his radio show im struck by just how likeable he is  and how capable a celebrity he is.    &lt;br&gt;I was glad he was a named thing on this story because if id told the same story without him id have tried harder to find cultiural integers everyone would know  to please the storyclub. plus obviously he half rhymes in the little tune she's humming to herself.&lt;br&gt;to make storyclub useful to ones self as guidance to more complex writing it is sometimes neccesary not to pass the tests of communicating everything because characterisation requires depth. to this end i try to vary stories week to week between funny and plotted with lots of jokes, over characterisation and something more esoteric like this which would be the seed of a proper length short story.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ah so it was literally Rylan’s teeth. I think because it was talking about it being this land, our land, I thought it might have been a landmark or something. I wasn’t sure that Rylan related back to the physical location. He is not the worst of the celebs.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting one but I didn’t buy into 100% there were a few bits that jarred until I read the comments below. Took me a while to figure out all the nuances. A little exclamation mark heavy. But maybe that fits into her character.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;you will see the exclamation marks are in character because there are few if any in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I thought that might be the case!!

I’m a bit confused by the very last sentence - the differences created by the haircut? Or by her class? The Splott reference implies that she’s not exactly riding high society (no offence to Splott of course, but if her and Stephan were living in Lisvane or somesuch I’d get it a bit more). The story tickles me doubly because my husband got over excite to finally find his clippers this week and accidentally took all his hair off... at least his was self inflicted mind...&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Hannah, its about class and how neither character can shake it off. Character one:  However one amasses things she knows the world will always look down its nose at her and that she will revert to the rough school girl she started out being, Character two: like EVERYONE i know in splott (not obvs everyone in splott), has been to uni, is well educated, etc she wants to look classless, to revel in difference and in throwing off the constraints of the 20th century class system, but is constrained by the &quot;way our sort of people&quot; as her mum might have said react, by guilt, class consciousness and a faint revulsion at the taste of the British working class. The whole story is also a parable on brexit, and the horrible national identity crisis which is currently engulfing us. Now ive explained it, for my own improvements as a writer, does it make sense?? I empathise with both characters.And both understand subconsciously what has played out.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;eg character 2 has Jenny's circs!! to name but one. though she is not jenny.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Lol definitely not jenny :-) she would never go out with a musician. Yes - totally makes sense and figured that’s what it meant - I was only wondered because of the word ‘looked’ and the fact that she is at least second generation Splottian as her Mum lives there too. Missed the whole Brexit analogy but thats pretty standard for me I’m not firing on all 4 most times! Anyway - great story and thanks for clarification&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;no that was kinda privately in my head to inspire me. they went to school together it is the hairdressers mum who lives in splott. i  imagine they maybe went to cathays where there are middle class and working class kids? the word in the last sentence could be &quot;seemed&quot; maybe.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Cherry blossom bride</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;A little too grave in places&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Well written piece...very earthy&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;vividly paints a picture. wish I could write like this&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Depressing.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>helen</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I like this and it very clearly paints a picture of how cold and disengaged the male character is.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;A tough read but extremely good!!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Funny face</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Nothing beats quiet neighbourly rage that’s built up over many years.

Love it!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Doo-doo stew</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;.This is horrific and wonderful - in an adult Roald Dahl kind of way. Really visceral and grim. I like how deranged Larry is, how detatched. I was expecting panic, remorse. The general darkness of this leads me to believe that this was Hannah...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I’m so glad this ended the way it did. Love it. Edge of psychopath mixed with childhood wonder. I just wasn’t sure who Casey was? Sister I assume. But maybe more could have been played on siblig rivalry’s but also reading on phone so may have missed bits. Really well written though.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;OH MY GOD.&lt;br&gt;The mind goggles, they do nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just, no. Ugh. This was horrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really well done!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 2 is really top - love the bare, skeletal silhouettes against the slate grey winter sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the kind of story I wish I had written. I like the tone of this is almost in two halves - poetic and evocative to begin, and then turns into full on gore wish-I-hadn't-read-this-before-breakfast-fest&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Rising to the occasion</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is great - really subtle and clever and the gradual revealing of what's going on is really nicely done. At first I thought our narrator was a creepy weirdo and Rose was his victim, but this is sweeter. It's like the start of an epic series! No idea who wrote it...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I needed Hannah's comment to properly understand what was going on, although it's all there (I never watched Buffy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the vampire bites the witch and then she lives for ever (warts and all).&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;As a huge Buffy fan (I named my firstborn xander for God sake…) I have to say I love this. It’s very sweet and sad, I can’t help but wonder about their future together, given that witches age and die and vampires do not. I liked the use of the itch to sandwich the narrative too - nice tidy little device that.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Lesliebody and the missed halloween debacle</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Good to see Leslie again. Ridiculous. I hoe we see more of Lesliebody in future stories&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Um.....&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Brilliant. Love the line ‘As they say in the TSH (torso-sans-head) community’. Also, bonus points for the most ridiculous use of tapeworm.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Halloween party</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;A slight overuse of &quot;then&quot; - then I stepped back, then the shape pressed against the window. Good point from Lewis about &quot;ken's rage&quot; slowing it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drab greyness of the gloomy evening comes over well.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ohhhh this is great! I figured it was Jenny from the off but the line about the flyer advertising a play about a tapeworm was a dead giveaway. Beautifully written with some lovely imagery. Really good one.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ha that is a great point - i can also imagine it happening and her sat in her window writing as the party rages on opposite&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yes. Love it. Nice bit of gruesome death. I think the sentence This was beyond i finally understood Ken’s rage jarred with me a bit though. It could have been cut as you loose the ‘oh my god if the blow up doll is in the bin, what’s in the window?’ Moment which would have added to the tension. But loved the last image of him begging to check the noise. Very nice work.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Jake</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is very tragic but beautiful in its own way. But I loved the way her life unfolds. The mother rings very true as well. Very bittersweet. I don’t think the meat factory section needs to be there it’s a bit too funny if that makes sense. But the emotional journey is really interesting and a great take on the theme.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>helen</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I loved this as Hannah mentioned it showed the different emotions of dealing with a child with serious illness. I liked that, the end, she'd come to be thankful for her past life but also grateful to her son for changing her life too.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Very very sad. The journey of emotions resentment, anger, nostalgia, sadness and (bitter? Or maybe hysterical? I can’t believe she’s simply amused at the realisation, feels more like the kind laugh you’d get when you’ve gone beyond the ‘normal’ range of emotions...) laughter is a great way to structure the piece.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;But yes I think it’s a sort of hysteria&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I think she is probably relieved at the self realisation which is hard to describe I guess in the words. Abd maybe her laughter is one memory of a great moment that crystal uses everything but I truly wrote through this one in one go. So I agree the last paragraph is not quite right&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;A refreshing change from all the rest of us who charged headlong at nudity for the uninhibited theme. I like where you took this.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I’m so inhibited I didn’t even think of nudity&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Powerflush</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>helen</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is funny and I enjoyed the fact that the two women seem to always play little tricks on each other.  It's a fun story but also shows that Marjorie was also getting revenge on the plumber.  Though I agree with the confusion of the last sentence - it may have been a stronger ending without saying 'this was the icing on the cake'. Still really enjoyed it though.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Enjoyed this, and the causal introduction of nudity. I just didn’t get the ending? Why was it revenge and was it revenge on the plumber or Valerie??  Other than that I think it was a lot of fun and read well.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Dual revenge.&lt;br&gt;Valerie was insufferable&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Other than that very entertaining, though I’ve  got to know that most of these stories involve female revenge , nakedness or both !!! However it’s still a great yarn&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Sorry I’m clearly being dense .....Valerie’s the plumber? Or is should the 9th last word be “him”&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;blockquote&gt;Or is should the 9th last word be “him”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oops. Good spot. (fixed now - ta)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>nudist dies on wobbly bridge</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I really liked this one. Great idea as the type of format and it really worked. Refreshing approach and nice and crazy.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Very silly. Like the news report format - nice idea for a bit of variation and works well with the subject matter&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Some very chortle inducing surreal lines in this - corpse mistaken for badger, and the bit about hedgehog excrement especially!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Surprising&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Crow pose</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>hannah</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This is fab - I knew Dave was going to join him. The offal line is genius! Very well written throughout&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Enjoyed the dialogue here. Flowed well. Good characters and nice fun story.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Was there meant to be serendipity?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>helen</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ha, this is hysterical and paints such a vivid picture!  Not quite sure if that's a good thing though.  Didn't really WANT to imagine a man doing the downward dog naked.  But thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;He could have at least tried to get him to stop with a basket of mini muffins first. Chortle chortle on this one too. Definite scope here for extending the farce and exploring why Dave whips his downward dig out so readily....&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>dan</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Funny&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>All at sea</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Wow...story number #1 for storyclub!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>All at badger</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Excellent opener, bit rambling in the middle to get to where we were going, though I did like Pete's Mum'[s samuri swords collection and their implications. End also hilarious. Hope badger is ok. I reckon 'Gonna' should be 'gonner' tho...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;A second comment to test the recent comments page...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;And this was story #2&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Dogfish beach</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;So this is a business trip? Wasn’t quite sure. And 1000 seems like a lot of people. General question are kids allowed on nudist beaches? Loved the descriptions and the emotions and the concept. I like the idea of the ending but for some reason I don’t love it. Maybe it could have been darker. Could you describe his scream or something like that? I think it needs a bit more of an edge. But overall a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;She screwed up some business account, so he's blackmailing her into a trip to the nudie beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that kids are allowed on nudist beaches. Blimey, google for naturism, not nudism!&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ah I thought they might have been there with a client trying to secure a deal&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;big suntan lotion contract!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Zombies</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Brutal ending! The twist at the end really brings home the fact that, hard as life now feels with a new baby, it's all pretty awesome really and harsh to have to leave it at that point. Clever take on the Zombie theme too.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;This seemed to be nice and realistic and wondered if the writer was speaking from experience or not? :) bleak, but honest, you get a really good snapshot of the moment and the mindless bickering, and a fun twist at the end.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Nice, non-literal take on the zombie theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sleep deprived life of the parents felt well realised, that despair and longing for nothing more than a good night's sleep (this piece is a pretty good contraceptive).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first thought on that last line was that it was jarring, added in for the sake of being a shocking ending. But on reflection I think it works - it highlights Simon's hazed out state, that sleep has deprived him of self awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could tweak it ever so slightly - instead of him thinking about Autumn, have him revel in the crispness of the new day, have him perk up that with the sounds of the birds singing, and then *bang*, dustbin lorry!&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Last</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I love the atmosphere and the tone of this. It's rally compelling and doesn't have the ring of a dodgy fantasy novel, which can sometimes happen in this style - it works really well. The only this is that I don't really understand what's happening - maybe more words could make it clearer? I'm not sure...Is it an 'I am Legend' scenario?&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Who knows! It’s all nonsense. Maybe it is. She offers herself as a sacrifice. Maybe that helps. Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yes, the atmosphere is a winner for me in this piece - and not in a compliment the lighting in Joey play kind of way. Nice touches, like the white bald head dipping in and out of the light, or the smoke uncoiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of places where the formatting lets it down - it almost needs a new line here and there to slow it down in a couple of places e.g. the bits when the mysterious man is talking and then switching into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the formatting how you wrote it? Have I introduced changes through the publishing process?&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking this one over...&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>The long slow hours of the night</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;I was intrigued to see where the twist would take me. Terrifying portrayal of office parties. I got bit confused By ‘at least I would be able to see Jess again’ sentence. Wasn’t sure if you were implying a possible something between them or whether it was just women sticking together against the onslaught. Some great descriptions and a strong finish which made it feel quite complete as a story.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Another good take on the zombie theme. Funny image of all the middle aged blokes thundering like a herd of animals to go dance to the village people&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>A new world</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Ha, love this - I like the set up of scary zombie apocalypse with cunning twist. Made me chuckle. Thought it was very visual and could see it play out like a film. YMCA ref seemed a little shoehorned, but forgivable :)&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Liked it. Actually thought it was a straight forward end of the world has caused armageddon and zombies; next that it was a kid in his bedroom. The twist made me laugh&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Great take on the theme. Accurate first week hangover description and fears. This was fun. Didn’t really get what was happening with the music? And the curtain? But that might just be me. Overall enjoyed it you knew there was gonna be a twist but didn’t expect it to be that which was well done.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul><h2>Roger the noble</h2><ul><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>jenny</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;The sob of thanks made me actually lol when I read it. This was my favourite this week. I think the confusion instigated at the start was nicely resolved by the end and forged an affinity with Roger and us - he's still thinking of his old life and the people he knew and slowly realises that everything has changed.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Well I’m fairly certain I know whose this was. No james mentioned. A good old farce, with some dark moments - the quiet sob of thanks she always gave... I got pretty confused as to where he was located - side room/ bedroom? I love the idea of a disconnected chimney being status symbol. The opening paragraph set scene of lots of characters and they weren’t really featured - perhaps if one of them had been with the wife at the end rather than an annomyous servant? I enjoyed the opening but it didn’t feel necessary to the story.&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The opening paragraph set scene of lots of characters and they weren’t really featured - perhaps if one of them had been with the wife at the end rather than an annomyous servant?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But needed to shoehorn in the village people! Point taken though - Ezra the miller had lost his tongue in an ill considered grindstone wager, so perhaps he should become the silent lover at the end&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Yes I like that, or perhaps they all get involved? All at it behind his back.&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>james</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;nice punning. a flaw in this plan of showing the comments is that you can work out who wrote a story by looking at the one they haven't commented on!&lt;/p&gt;</p><li><ul><div class="comment-content"><header><a>lewis</a></header></div><p>&lt;p&gt;Unless we comment on our own as well&lt;/p&gt;</p></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></main><aside></aside><footer>               <a href="mailto:storymarmalade@gmail.com">storymarmalade@gmail.com                                </a><a href="https://twitter.com/storymarmalade">twitter: storymarmalade</a></footer></body></html>
