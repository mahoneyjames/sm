It seems that living in the big smoke wasn’t as dreamy and filtered as all the Instagram posts made out. It wasn’t all flat whites in trendy cafes and cute dinner parties in loft apartments. Heather’s ‘spacious living space’ was essentially a half converted garage, hidden away round the back of an ex-council house on an unsavoury estate. True, she had more space than a lot of other people in London but the garage conversion had stopped short of including a fully functioning window. Instead, the main rusting door have been spliced open and a sheet of misty Perspex wedged into place.\r\n\r\nA month ago, Heather would have given her right arm to be in the city with all the action. Now, she spends lonely evenings in her sparse quarters looking at videos on the internet of pets doing silly things. Puppies playing chase with llamas and budgies singing the national anthem. This wasn’t the new life she had hoped for. \r\n\r\nMoving to the end of her mattress, she held her phone at arm’s length and snapped a pouting selfie. Being sure to include the huge framed picture of her last beach holiday which hung on the wall behind her head, she added a ‘crema’ filter and posted her third Instagram of the day #lovinglife #newbeginnings #londontown.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gHLJljs_J1-t7Y41MKAuZT9T1sBpt6NTAbR__C7Hz4k/edit","order":8,"format":"google","errors":[],"publicId":"newbeginnings","html":"<p>‘Welcome to part one of the new enlightened road to mindfulness and meditation.
