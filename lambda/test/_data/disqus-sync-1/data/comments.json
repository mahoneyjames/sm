I like your dry take on the difference between a) the lives people lead, b) the lives they want to lead and c) the lives they convince other people that they actually are leading. Esp. like the ‘crema’ filter detail! I thought the three sections hung together a little awkwardly - with all the dialogue in the first bit, then switching to past and then back to present. It might work if you either smoothed that out or made the differences more deliberately definite, so it’s a feature, if that makes sense? At first I thought Heather was leading a meditation class when she was interrupted, which would also have been awkwardly fun</p>","when":"2018-09-14T15:49:35","parentId":null},{"themeId":"new-beginnings","storyId":"nd21jm0g26cw","storyPublicId":"newbeginnings","storyTitle":"#newbeginnings","id":"4092984454","userId":"james","text":"<p>I do like the whole pastures new turn out to be a bit shit theme of the piece, and I especially like the comment on the falseness of social media posturing at the end there!</p>","when":"2018-09-13T10:46:04","parentId":null},{"themeId":"new-beginnings","storyId":"nd21jm0g281z","storyPublicId":"oreo","storyTitle":"Oreo","id":"4095489422","userId":"lewis","text":"<p>Well that’s sad.

If you haven’t read it I think you’ll like it. I really like the switch in perspective that let us into the whole picture and revealed how clueless poor Oreo was to his fate. I think more clarity around Sarah’s character might have been interesting, and the relationship between her and Molly - was it a little resentful on either or both sides? I guess you’d need longer than 500 words to accomplish that! I think you got a lot of emotion and detail in a really short story :)</p>","when":"2018-09-14T15:50:33","parentId":null},{"themeId":"new-beginnings","storyId":"nd21jm0g281z","storyPublicId":"oreo","storyTitle":"Oreo","id":"4092984691","userId":"james","text":"<p>I like the new beginning for Sarah mirrored with the end of things for Oreo. I was a little confused in the beginning with switch between Sarah and Molly. The emotional impact of a dog being put to sleep was diluted because clearly Oreo was on his last legs.

I like the stallion’s penis turning out to be an actual stallion’s penis, but I’m not sure I bought Gloria’s reaction. After so much online dating she must have experienced a fair few weirdos and I think she’d either be nonplussed at such oddness OR she’d love it and ask to sample each one in turn and they’d end up living happily ever after in the garage.

I think I got it, but there’s too much uncertainty at the beginning which made me feel like I was missing something. I like the She is the cat’s mother thing and the idea of a conspiracy of dogs being overturned by cats using their love and stupidity against them (quid pro quo for what they did to humans, maybe?). With a little reworking, and maybe letting it get a bit longer, this could be really excellent and funny too, but it feels like a first draft</p>","when":"2018-09-14T15:52:33","parentId":null},{"themeId":"new-beginnings","storyId":"nd21jm0g2crt","storyPublicId":"who-is-she-or-everyone-loves-a-box-of-puppies.","storyTitle":"Who is she?
