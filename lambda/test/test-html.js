Her grandchildren were bloated and sticky from guzzling her experiments as she worked tirelessly to discover a cupcake that would erase the memory of Mrs Ap Glyn’s astonishing Magical Mystery Muffins from last year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe village was awash with mistrust.

This year she had a plan. She had made dozens of different cakes - experimenting with everything, from adding beetroot to marscapone icing (inadvisable), to mixing vanilla essence with cardamom and icing sugar (roaring success). Now she knew she had it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe’d make a cinnamon and ginger spiced sponge base (with real ginger chunks in syrup), topped with her newly discovered cardamom icing.

But then, when she looked up, there was Mrs Ap Glyn squinting at her through mascaraed lashes! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Jones thought fast. Mrs Ap Glyn’s myopia was well known, she couldn’t have seen what Mrs Jones had bought, but she’d be down like a shot to inspect the shelf where she’d been standing. That woman would stop at nothing. Nothing! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash, Mrs Jones grabbed a big bag of flour and placed it strategically in front of the tins of syrup and, with a sweep of her hand, she knocked the remains of the ginger out of sight behind the condensed milk. She’d have to trust to fate now; she had to get home - the competition was tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big day arrived. The smell of baking and the stench of fear was rife, but Mrs Jones strode confidently into the village hall and plopped her wicker basket on the judging table, next to Mrs Ap Glyn’s.

            "content": "There was a terrible ringing sound. It was filling the room, filling my head - why the hell wouldn’t it stop? My hand sought the offending article and I answered it from under my pillow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hello?” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh ya, hi Ashley, it’s Michelle?” I knew that upward inflection, but...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Michelle who?” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Your cousin Michelle? From London?” she sounded exasperated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hi Michelle - you ok?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh um, you know. So anyway, you need to go to Nana’s, OK?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Nana’s? Why?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well her neighbour phoned, she says there’s this, like, smell? Coming from Nana’s house? I obviously can’t go, so…”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“How am I meant to get there? I don’t have a car!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well I can’t exactly come from London! Just go and make sure she’s OK?” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe rang off. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI gave myself a minute to wake up and I realised what this meant. Nana. Jesus. I usually phoned her every Friday, but last Friday there had been tequila and now it was (I checked my phone) Tuesday. Shit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHer house was 40 minutes away by train. I could be with her by eleven. I threw on my jeans and an old scratchy jumper that Nana had made. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe’d always been close. We liked the same books and she had painstakingly showed me how to knit scarves and and mittens. Every winter I’d receive a bulky care package from her, containing a freshly knitted jumper, chocolate and a tenner in an envelope marked ‘don’t tell your mother’.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe train ride was terrible. Nana had always been super active. She still did yoga for Christ sake, she wasn’t likely to just give up. She had a panic button for emergencies, wore her inhaler on a string around her neck and her neighbours were a shout away. She was fine, I told myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly mum had said that she seemed...vaguer lately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had sounded tired when we spoke on the phone last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe usually called me if I’d missed a call to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI ran to her front door and the smell hit me. It was revolting; no wonder the neighbours had complained. Inside the stench was unbearable. I covered my face with my sleeve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Nana?” no answer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Nana, it’s Ashley...” Nothing. The smell was coming from the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI walked towards it and saw that the door was shut. And then I noticed it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom under the door a thick, dark fluid had seeped out, soaking into the carpet. My heart sped up. I had to go in; I thought I was going to be sick.

My hand sought the offending article and I answered it from under my pillow</p>\n<p>“Hello?” </p>\n<p>“Oh ya, hi Ashley, it’s Michelle?” I knew that upward inflection, but...</p>\n<p>“Michelle who?” </p>\n<p>“Your cousin Michelle? From London?” she sounded exasperated.</p>\n<p>“Hi Michelle - you ok?”</p>\n<p>“Oh um, you know. So anyway, you need to go to Nana’s, OK?”</p>\n<p>“Nana’s? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Well her neighbour phoned, she says there’s this, like, smell? Coming from Nana’s house? I obviously can’t go, so…”</p>\n<p>“How am I meant to get there? I don’t have a car!”</p>\n<p>“Well I can’t exactly come from London! Just go and make sure she’s OK?” </p>\n<p>She rang off. </p>\n<p>I gave myself a minute to wake up and I realised what this meant. Nana. Jesus. I usually phoned her every Friday, but last Friday there had been tequila and now it was (I checked my phone) Tuesday. Shit. </p>\n<p>Her house was 40 minutes away by train. I could be with her by eleven. I threw on my jeans and an old scratchy jumper that Nana had made. </p>\n<p>We’d always been close. We liked the same books and she had painstakingly showed me how to knit scarves and and mittens. Every winter I’d receive a bulky care package from her, containing a freshly knitted jumper, chocolate and a tenner in an envelope marked ‘don’t tell your mother’.</p>\n<p>The train ride was terrible. Nana had always been super active. She still did yoga for Christ sake, she wasn’t likely to just give up. She had a panic button for emergencies, wore her inhaler on a string around her neck and her neighbours were a shout away. She was fine, I told myself.</p>\n<p>Only mum had said that she seemed...vaguer lately.</p>\n<p>She had sounded tired when we spoke on the phone last.</p>\n<p>She usually called me if I’d missed a call to her.</p>\n<p>I ran to her front door and the smell hit me. It was revolting; no wonder the neighbours had complained. Inside the stench was unbearable. I covered my face with my sleeve.</p>\n<p>“Nana?” no answer</p>\n<p>“Nana, it’s Ashley...” Nothing. The smell was coming from the kitchen.</p>\n<p>I walked towards it and saw that the door was shut. And then I noticed it. </p>\n<p>From under the door a thick, dark fluid had seeped out, soaking into the carpet. My heart sped up. I had to go in; I thought I was going to be sick. In one quick movement I threw open the door and gagged with the foulness of the stench that met me.</p>\n<p>The pipe under the sink was in bits.

We liked each other; took turns tending the communal garden, collected each others mail, shared meals in one anothers’ kitchens, looked after baby Daisy when Alison worked shifts...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut not Hector. He lived on the top floor, my floor, and never joined in or did his share. He played his loud, out-of-tune piano when everyone was asleep on a Saturday morning. He smoked in his flat and pretended he didn’t. He even fell asleep running his bath, flooding poor Derek’s living room, ruining his collection of paper lanterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, none of us liked sharing the building with Hector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt didn’t surprise us when an oddly shaped box appeared outside his flat, blocking the corridor, his name printed clearly on the top. I had to lift up my bike to pass it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was still there when I got home, so I decided that something must be done. I rapped smartly on his door and arranged my features to convey polite firmness. He peered through his horn-rimmed spectacles, brushing matter from his brown, threadbare dressing gown. His hair tufted in white clumps at the sides of his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hector?” I began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who?” he asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Mr Bagshaw?” I corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who’re you looking for, missy?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hector I’m looking for you - there’s a parcel…”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sorry, wrong flat. No Hector here.” The door slammed shut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning the parcel was gone. I was confused, but let it pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil it happened again; Alison fell over it and he’d said the same to her. So we convened in my kitchen - Alison and Daisy, Derek and Mr Thatcher from the ground floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Maybe he’s forgotten who he is - he’s getting on a bit…” posed Derek\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“He knows what he’s doing.” Mr Thatcher said. “I’ll wager whatever’s in that box he’s too embarrassed to say is his.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe peered out. It was certainly an unusual shape and alarmingly large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy morning, it had vanished. As I wheeled my bike out Mr Thatcher gave me a knowing look. We knew what had to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen another package appeared in the hall, no-one wasted time asking Hector. Together we dragged it into my kitchen and opened it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well” said Derek “I never expected that.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Thatcher whistled. “Who’d have thought  - at his age too!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI reached down and lifted it out. Suddenly there was a loud banging on my door!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey scattered. Alison grabbed Daisy and hid in the bathroom. I brushed my hair back and calmly opened the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Hector, veins popping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Miss Jones - have you seen…” he peered past me to where his box disgorged its contents over my floor. I had to think fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who?” I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“MISS Jones…”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Who?” I asked innocently “Who are you looking for, sir?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now look here, that box is mine - you’ve no right…”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, I don’t know who you mean.

It saunters off haughtily, tangling its tail around my sister’s feet as she drops the hula hoop for the thousandth time that day and smacks it on the head. It screams and does an undignified sort of lunge sideways, burying itself in the piles of discarded wrapping paper, covering itself in sellotape. It hisses and upsets itself more by trying to remove the sellotape - along with its fur, clawing frantically at it and removing the last of its assumed dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNana laughs at the cat. She is dribbling lasciviously down her wrinkled chin and my sister cries, thinking Nana is laughing at her, which of course she is. The cat is sulking, Nana is cackling, Anita has reached the guttural, howling stage of upset and Dad tries to melt inconspicuously into his chair, nibbling a dry Jacob’s Cream Cracker and staring at the muted Queen on the television, pretending that his life couldn’t possibly have come to this. The room is a cacophony of noise, smell, defeat, and, from the cat, violent resentment..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt all goes wrong after dinner, as it always does when you play Monopoly and Nana’s had five sherries and Anita’s already been sick from all the chocolate coins she ate for breakfast and is still shovelling them down thick and fast. There’s only so far Dad’s forced merriment can take you; something’s got to give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt gives when Nana is caught stealing money from the Monopoly bank. Of course we all know and say nothing, as usual, but when Anita spots it, everything kicks royally off, because she was losing and the game has to be put quickly away. Anita is crying again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMum hurries to the blender to get Nana’s Christmas pudding ready - otherwise the raisins get stuck terrifyingly between her false teeth. Nobody says anything for a while, so Dad un-mutes the television until Nana says something racist to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the heavy silence we listen through the walls to the sound of next door laughing and chatting. Our lack of cheer hangs heavily in the room, mingling with Nana’s cigar smoke. Dad helps her over to the settee to finish her ghastly Christmas pudding smoothie. She drinks it noisily, smacking her lips and Anita begins to look nauseous again; she quells the feeling with another chocolate coin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe sit silently, each of us wrapped in our own, unique little balls of Christmas hell, but it is a long time until anyone notices that Nana hasn’t said anything offensive or made any kind of bodily noise for far longer than usual; we’ve all been braced for the next one and it is surprising when it doesn’t come. Something is definitely wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDad attempts to rally her from afar, not even he wants to approach her. Nothing. Dad creeps over, touches her face gently, but withdraws, suddenly, as if burned. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext door the sound of Wham’s Last Christmas floats poignantly through the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Anita is crying again.</p>\n<p>Mum hurries to the blender to get Nana’s Christmas pudding ready - otherwise the raisins get stuck terrifyingly between her false teeth. Nobody says anything for a while, so Dad un-mutes the television until Nana says something racist to it.</p>\n<p>In the heavy silence we listen through the walls to the sound of next door laughing and chatting. Our lack of cheer hangs heavily in the room, mingling with Nana’s cigar smoke. Dad helps her over to the settee to finish her ghastly Christmas pudding smoothie. She drinks it noisily, smacking her lips and Anita begins to look nauseous again; she quells the feeling with another chocolate coin.</p>\n<p>We sit silently, each of us wrapped in our own, unique little balls of Christmas hell, but it is a long time until anyone notices that Nana hasn’t said anything offensive or made any kind of bodily noise for far longer than usual; we’ve all been braced for the next one and it is surprising when it doesn’t come. Something is definitely wrong.</p>\n<p>Dad attempts to rally her from afar, not even he wants to approach her. Nothing. Dad creeps over, touches her face gently, but withdraws, suddenly, as if burned. </p>\n<p>Next door the sound of Wham’s Last Christmas floats poignantly through the walls.</p>\n"

The roast potatoes shattered crisply and joined the mush. The sprouts bounced valiantly for a few seconds before they succumbed. I made a futile grab for the poor pig in blanket. \r\n\r\nWhen the latest whir was done I said, ‘Honey…’\r\n\r\nShe went for my cracker, tossed the broken half aside in disgust and lunged for her own.

Don’t forget to bring extra crisps for my lunch tomorrow, yeah?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a spiteful laugh Chris cycled off, kicking a cloud of dust at Sam as he went. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSam gathered his things, brushing the mud off his leotard and collecting his dance shoes from either side of the road. Chris had taken his trainers and his rucksack so he bundled his ballet gear up in his hands and started, barefoot, for home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt lunch the next day Chris slid his empty tray over to Sam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Fish and chips for me love, will you?” He winked and sprawled out on the bench. When the others turned their backs to join the queue Chris mimed dainty ballet moves at him and Sam took the tray, paid for both meals and said not a word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe put Chris’ lunch tray down and went to sit elsewhere, but Chris wasn’t having any of it. He pulled Sam down to the bench beside him and launched into the conversation, spraying chip fragments as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Boys, saw this programme on telly last night about these queer boys doing ballet”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis eyes flashed dangerously at Sam as he grinned and put on a falsetto voice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Daaarling run me a bubble bath I must prepare my pirouette.” He fluttered his hands and laughed, showing the chewed up food coating his tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was some scattered laughter. Sam said nothing. Chris enjoyed this balancing act; threatening to tip his secret into public knowledge at any moment, then hauling it back into precarious safety for a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sambo, where’s my crisps today?” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWordlessly Sam took a packet of ready salted from his bag and watched Chris devour them. He saw the other boys exchange looks then stare at him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end of year was approaching. The last day of school was always a talent show in the assembly hall instead of lessons. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day itself the corridors filled with bustling students carrying musical instruments, sheaves of paper, armfuls of homemade costumes. Beautiful Bella Davies flounced around in black cherry lipstick and layers of chiffon, drawing the gaze of every boy in the school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChris’ gang would sit at the back being as obnoxious as they could. Sam, however, had other plans. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the curtain rose to reveal Sam and Bella locked in an elegant embrace, arms and legs entwined, Sam could practically hear Chris’ jaw hitting the floor. And when he executed a perfect grande jete the entire hall erupted in rapturous applause. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sam and Bella took their bow, Sam took the microphone and waited for the reverent hush to descend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Thank you so much. Bella and I have worked so hard on today’s performance. There’s one person in particular that I must mention. Chris Giles. Your support has meant everything. I’m sorry things didn’t work out between us in the way you hoped. I tried to be what you needed, but I couldn’t lie to either of us anymore. Know that Bella and I wish you all the happiness you deserve. I’ll always treasure our time together...”",

Female, as in slightly disturbed by your department’s drive to produce a range of female only sex-bots. \r\n\r\nYes, that one. \r\n\r\nYes, I understand you’ve taken my feedback on board, and I’m looking at your response right now. But tell me, when you went ahead and designed a range of male sex-bots, did you – by any chance – talk to any women?\r\n\r\nI see. And these women weren’t bitter former lovers, or they had some kind of python fetish? I see. Excuse me one moment. \r\n\r\n_Gary, set me up a meeting with the officer in charge of local mental health. Thank you._\r\n\r\nBack to the matter in hand. Yes, I’m looking at it, right now. Yes, impressive is a word I would pick, but also horrifying, and horrified – that’s me, by the way. Yes, yes, I understand your point, but here’s the thing. Yes, I know I’m not an expert in robotics, but I think perhaps you’ve gone slightly overboard when your demo model turns around quickly and sweeps an entire cabinet free of glassware. \r\n\r\nYes, yes, we’ve all noticed the “girth”. For this you consulted? I see, yes, Cosmopolitan magazine. \r\n\r\nSorry, what was that? Bubble bath? Ballet? Now you’re just reading from the feature “ten top tips for a perfect date night” on page fifty-seven. \r\n\r\nBack to the matter in hand. Let’s see. How can I put this? When a Daddy really loves a Mummy they take their clothes off and he puts his…insider her…yes, that’s right. I can’t decide what would happen if this thing ever got near a real woman, he’d either push her off the bed or inflict some hideous internal injuries. \r\n\r\nYes, yes, the muscles are certainly impressive. Sorry, what’s that? Give him a can of diet coke? Why would I? Fine.\r\n\r\n_Gary. A can of diet coke for our “guest”._\r\n\r\nYes, yes, he’s opening it now, and – oh, I see. Yes. Very impressive. He’s now drinking diet coke and cleaning windows at the same time. No, the female members of my office have not been driven into a state of sexual agitation. No! I will not play Etta James.\r\n\r\nAnd no…hang on. Yes, now I understand why you felt the need to equip him with an appendage that prehensile.

At least it wasn’t upside down. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStumbling down the corridor she tripped over her own slippers. That’s where they were! What kind of sleep deprived zombie would leave her slippers in the middle of the landing, she berated herself, rubbing her elbow where she had knocked it on the wall. The next day it would be yet another bruise whose origin she could not recall. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHer back ached as she hauled the baby from the cot and he groped for her breast. Sitting there in the dark she struggled to stay awake while he snuffled and suckled hungrily. Her mind wandered back to her life before children. She had never appreciated how much sleep she’d had, for starters! And how limber she had been. Her years of ballet had served her well, her body had been strong and supple, and despite her slight figure she had borne him well, with an uneventful pregnancy and a calm gentle birth. The months since had been a different story. As the relaxin had fled her body she was left with back pain from which no bubble bath could offer relief, and a pelvic floor which left her dreading every sneeze. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe glanced down at her infant. The dim light from his night light illuminated only the bare minimum of his features, but she knew every millimetre of the visage from the hours she had spent gazing at him, in this exact position, as he fed from the body in which he had grown. The slightly upturned nose, the beautiful long eyelashes, the dimple in his chin, the soft downiness of his hair. She had never known she could feel this strongly about anything. That she could go through so much for such a tiny being, so much pain and exhaustion and frustration and irritation, and still feel a love which brought tears to her eyes and a lump to her throat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe bent forwards to place a gentle kiss on his forehead, lifted him sleepily back into the cot, and tiptoed from the room.

I was awake, or half awake, so I saw it before you woke up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room was dark and without my glasses I could make out the blurry shapes and shadows of the unfamiliar room, gently lit by the firelight.

You didn’t believe me until you heard the creak of the floorboards upstairs. That made you stop. Strange how much less scared I felt when you showed me your fear. You pressed the button on your phone and it was blindingly bright. When we could see we looked around the room, but there was nothing strange and we began to relax. You even put your arm around me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe creaking began again. Slow, steady pacing. Deliberate. Wanting to be heard. I looked at you and I suppose you felt you had to go. Shivering you got up and flipped the light switch. Of course it didn’t work. Slowly, barefoot, you climbed the stairs.

It never really seemed like a good idea after that night. In fact, the next morning I slipped up and quickly turned the key in the lock without looking inside. I threw it into the lake. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I ever hear the sound of pacing, I just close the door to my bedroom tight, tight and squeeze my eyelids together.

I’d tried telling her it was cruel, a waste of time, that it was exploitative. Nothing. Even this appeal for Andre’s dignity failed to move her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndre looked balefully out from his basket under the table. I shot him a glance of commiseration, but we both knew there was nothing I could do. He tried to retreat back under his blanket but Ellie had already picked him up by his pudgy middle and was trying to squeeze the tiny plastic raincoat over his head. He didn’t struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Why would a dog need a raincoat? They love water! They love being wet!” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUseless. My arguments, like Andre, were lost to Ellie’s latest fad. She was already Instagramming the two of them together, she pouting, he defeatedly gazing at the screen, his little legs dangling through the yellow plastic sleeves. Poor little sod. She added a flattering filter, some little cartoon raindrops and a few lurid hearts. Her phone was soon buzzing with Likes and she tapped happily away at it, revelling in the adulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had to be fair; as sorry as I felt for Andre and as awful, vacuous and shallow as I found my little sister’s passion for dressing him up and posing, I had to admit that she had a flair for fashion. The little coat was meticulously designed and sewn together with real skill. She’d been making paper dresses for Barbie since she was old enough to be allowed scissors, despite our mother’s best attempts to interest her in nature, The Great Outdoors, sports - anything that wasn’t pink and frilly. My sister turned out a rebel in glittery shoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now it was Andre’s turn. Barbie was old news, abandoned in a corner without a stitch on. Humiliated. ‘At least’ I thought ‘this probably won’t last long - she’s probably bored of it already and when she grows up she’ll start working on clothes for real people. When she’s a famous designer, we’ll look back and laugh. Andre will be alright...’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you a bit old for dressing up toys and pets now?” I said in my most patronising tone. I wanted to embarrass her. Ellie looked at me with undisguised contempt. I squirmed, uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“This shit sells for silly money. People love dressing their pets up - Instagram is full of it. Why do you think I never need cash? Knock a few of these out, share them online and the requests come flooding in. Some people” she told me wisely “have more money than sense.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe emptied the contents of her school satchel onto the carpet. There was a tiny, four-legged sailor outfit, complete with hat; a little stetson and gun holster, with fringed chaps; four perfect replica Converse daps and even a pink tutu and tiara. I shuddered and felt old. Ellie picked up her camera determinedly. Andre whimpered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It was nearly 10.30pm and she’d been here since work ended early (at four) for the Christmas do. Outside rain streamed down the window and she found herself wishing she was out in it, walking home to a hot bath. She perched on the scratchy grey office chair with her tight knees together and clutching the same paper cup of wine she’d been handed an hour ago. It was rancid. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe knew she’d have to act soon, or David would be there next to her spraying her with flecks of egg and innuendo, but she was so new - she didn’t want to seem like she wasn’t keen. They’d been telling stories all day about losers who left early rather than making the most of the free food and booze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You only live once, eh Natasha?” David had said to Natalie and Chris had laughed. They’d bumped fists, shirt buttons straining and grey chin-flesh wobbling. Chris had left by 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was too late, he was heading straight for her, there was nothing she could do. He fell into the seat next to her beginning a conversation with her blouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid was drunk. He leaned in close to speak to her, still chewing, mumbling, not making much sense. His wife definitely didn’t understand him and he was very much looking forward to working with Natalie, even if he couldn’t quite remember her name or what she did at the company. His hand kept creeping towards her thigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen David got up to ‘refresh their glasses’ Natalie noticed that his filofax had fallen out of his jacket pocket, open at next week’s date. There was an entry for Monday:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Meeting: SEO WarpCore - URGENT - DO NOT MISS!! 11.45” The ‘urgent’ was underlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick as a flash Natalie grabbed the pen from her bag at added 2 lines to the second ‘1’, so that it said ‘14.45’ instead of 11.45. She closed it and stood up to leave just as David returned with their drinks. Aside from poor passed-out Marjorie over there they were the only ones left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe flashed him her most seductive smile as she handed him the filofax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here, you dropped this” she cooed “wouldn’t want you to miss anything important!” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Clever little girl” he slurred “Dunno what I’d do if I lost this -  they’d kill me if I missed next week’s meeting - my job’s on the line there! You just saved my job Natasha, how can I ever repay you?”A lecherous grin spread over his face. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh, it was my pleasure” she breathed and walked sexily out of the office feeling his eyes trailing up and down her body.

Mary gestured to the side of the tennis court and Roger, looking around nervously, followed her. They sat side by side on the grass watching their spouses. Roger didn’t look at Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You know they’re screwing?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary nodded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Does everyone know?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary watched Hillary bend slowly down to fetch the ball, legs apart, eyes on Nigel, who’d broken out in a sweat.

Roger looked confused, then horrified, before finally resigning himself and nodding unhappily. He followed Mary around to where the bins were at the back of the resort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey faced each other awkwardly. A bee flew past and Roger watched it intently until it had gone and he was forced to return to the task in hand. Even then he stared over Mary’s shoulder, fascinated by an unusual cactus in a window.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Right. Well. Maybe put your hand here?” Mary put Roger’s hand on her breast and he held it, not knowing where to look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing impatient Mary launched herself at Roger, ramming her tongue between his lips. Roger panicked, stumbled, fell. Mary was on her back, thrashing, moaning, skirt round her hips, Roger on top of her flailing helplessly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh!” She cried “Yes!” Finally - passion, excitement, lust, everything she’d been waiting for! Roger squirmed and Mary pushed his face into hers. They struggled together on the path as Mary held Roger’s head in place with one hand and worked frantically to remove his shorts with the other. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly a shadow fell over them. Mary released Roger in shock and he sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You bastard!” said the shadow, as it turned and fled, weeping, down the path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Wait” called Roger, distraught “Nigel, wait - come back, it’s only ever been you - you know that!” He ran after him, struggling with his shorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary sat disconsolately for a moment, before standing, brushing off the dust and straightening her clothes. Slowly she walked around to the tennis court. Hillary was sitting on a bench looking defeated. Mary sat beside her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Did you know?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary shook her head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But he’s your husband!” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary shrugged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Does everyone know?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary looked across the holiday resort. Nigel was gesturing hysterically, Roger, pleading. Mary nodded and put a hand on Hillary’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You know” said Mary “if you wanted, we could…”",

That hideous, washed-out, wretched, rotten sensation: that no-one will ever want you \r\n\r\nagain, and how the hell did anyone want you to begin with?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt had never been me, though. I͛d always been the dumper, and until I͛d been on the receiving end, \r\n\r\nhad always thought people who got dumped had it easy. The dumpees got to do the downtrodden, \r\n\r\nself-righteous, wronged act, and everyone felt sorry for them. Whereas people like me, all we got \r\n\r\nwas the guilt. That and the dreadful nervous feeling in your tummy for weeks before – you know the \r\n\r\none? It͛s like you͛re hungry, but also nauseous, but also need a crap? But neither eating nor vomiting \r\n\r\nnor shitting will fix you. The only cure is to get on and dump that waste of space. But then you \r\n\r\nreplace the nervousness with guilt, and maybe regret, and possibly a bit of doubt, and all your \r\n\r\nfriends are too busy feeling sorry for your poor dumped ex to spare a thought for how you͛re feeling. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, I get that now. Being dumped is SO much worse. It͛s like being stung by a bee – there͛s no \r\n\r\nwarning. You think you͛re happy, going for a nice walk in the country, then he turns to you and says, \r\n\r\n'We have to talk'. When does that ever lead anywhere good? And then you wish you were the \r\n\r\nbloody bee – you͛ve wreaked your vengeance on the cruel, honey-thieving world, and now you can \r\n\r\njoin the great swarm in the sky. But you͛re not a bee. You just have to keep going, finish the walk, \r\n\r\ntrying not to fall down Pen Y Fan even though you can͛t see a foot in front of you for your tears (let͛s \r\n\r\nbe honest, fucking Wales, the visibility was only about 5 metres anyway!). Then there͛s the silent, \r\n\r\nawkward car journey home. Why the hell did he have to take me there to do it? Surely a walk down \r\n\r\nBroadway would have sufficed. I could have run home in 2 minutes and never seen him again. Twat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, the first thing I do when I finally get out of his car (and his life) for the last time? Straight \r\n\r\ninto the kitchen to smash that frickin' cactus he loves so much. No, you can͛t come and get your \r\n\r\nplant, Tim, you gave that to me. I don͛t care if you've had it since you were 10, you gave it to me 'as \r\n\r\na token of your love’ and it's mine to do what I want with. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourse, the problem with cacti is they͛re bloody prickly, and the problem with heart-break is it tends \r\n\r\nto make you a bit irrational.

And until that Halloween he never had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been a crisp, empty day, the air bright and still and, as dusk approached, the scattered houses in the clearing one by one began to light up and glow in the soft, insistent twilight. Sam followed his friends into the woods, where the darkness coiled around them all, like smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir little lights glowed faintly and they whispered and giggled together, feeding off each others’  excitement and fear. It was a just a game, a Halloween dare, until the noise began. They froze. Silence. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen that grating painful shrieking seemed to merge with the darkness to stifle the group of small boys where they huddled and knew, suddenly, that it wasn’t a game anymore. That maybe it never had been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the noise stopped the group seemed to breath again and they began to move off together, staying, perhaps, a little closer now, perhaps a fraction less confidently, perhaps listening just that little bit harder to sieve out any sounds in the thick air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly now they didn’t know where they were. Only now the trees loomed out of the dark at them, leering and reaching with fingers that snatched and caught and scraped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then Sam was alone with the darkness. He could hear the voices and the footsteps of his friends calling to each other, running, falling moving away from him. Sam stood still until the silence once again seeped in and blotted out everything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then steps in the darkness. The heavy, sturdy tread of a man’s boots crushing twigs and leaves, coming through the tangle of branches towards Sam, whose breath came fast and in clouds of ghostly white. He didn’t wait, he scrambled one, two, three up the nearest tree and just in time. The boots came into view just beneath him on the ground. Sam perched on the narrow branch and held his breath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeside him was a fragile nest of tiny twigs and mottled feathers. Nestled together in the middle were three brown speckled eggs and a single bright feather, so bright that it almost seemed to glow in the darkness. It was a beautiful and hopelessly delicate thing in the midst of his fear and Sam forgot the man below, forgot the darkness, forgot his pounding heart and reached for it...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sam woke he was wrapped in a rough blanket that smelled of woodsmoke and animals. He was tucked up against his front door. It was still dark, there was still time to creep back inside before mum noticed he was missing. Sam sat up and pushed aside the blanket, not wondering where it had come from, but when he opened his hand a bright feather fell out and drifted gently to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The furthest he ever got was a quarter mile down the road, next to where they drop the letters off for the postman. It was her brought him back - special delivery for you, Mr Martin.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI sat Maggie down at the dinner table, put on my serious face and waited for the end of the giggles.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n‘Did you let Boots out of the garden?’\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJust the thought of that earnest face ringed with curls of gold makes me tear.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n'No Daddy, of course not. Boots lets himself out.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI’ve been over every inch of that fence, I’ve weaved chicken wire through the bottom of the gate railings. So come on, you bastard, let’s see you get out. Boots on the patio, me on the bench with medicinal whisky.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe next thing I know it’s morning, I'm stiff and there's no sign of Boots.

This is mine and Maggie’s favourite spot; a whole other world just a few minutes from the road. Willows weep their leaves from the banks, water tumbles over rocks.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd there a flash of bright blue, and there another. It’s Mr and Mrs Kingfisher.

Sweetheart?” Renoir asked unsuccessfully masking his annoyance at the interruption. \r\n\r\n“There was sumfing over there, i swear.” \r\n\r\n“This is a private beach, my dear, you know that. It’s probably a seagull.” \r\n\r\nShenise hurumphed a little and wriggled herself back down onto the towel, positioning her magazine perfect figure for maximum sun exposure. Her oil lathered bare chest glistened  like two perfectly formed and entirely unnatural hills glistening with morning dew. Which was not the thought of Kev, Dev and Aled who’s hearts were now beginning to slow to a normal pace, as they remained frozen against the sand bank, desperately hoping they hadn’t been spotted and that they hadnt wasted their £20 each. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRenoir (not his original name) continued, speculating on the undeniable benefits of automatic inclusion in the World Trade Organisation rules. It was hard to tell if Shenise was asleep due to the Giant sunglasses that covered her face, but as he gazed into into his own reflection he wondered why he bothered telling those kids when he was down here with a new girl. He was rich enough not to need the £20 per kid.  Perhaps it was the admiration he saw in their eyes. For that brief moment he saw himself as a hero to them, someone to admire and respect.  He shrugged off the thought that it had anything to do with his days of unnoticed youth. That it was just using his money to give them the sort of thrill he’d never had access to when he was young. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShenise snorted and woke herself up with a start. Renoir stopped the uncomfortable thought train chugging around his mind and took up his pre-rehearsed epic speech. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElsewhere Aled tried desperately not to reveal his erection as he peered through Kevs ancient periscope at his first real life breasts, cementing an, unknown to him at the time, cripplingly unrealistic expectation of female chests that he would only get over when Alice, his 17 year old love of his life made him watch a Netflix documentary on plastic surgery and modern day female body images.  For now he merely wondered how Renoir did it; all these girls, a new one every month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDev however was more concerned with if he would be able to hide his ejection better than Aled when it was his turn. He was under no illusions how’s Renoir did it, his father having been on the Risk end of one of Renoir’s High Risk, High Reward investment schemes that had left him thoroughly underwhelmed with his fathers business acumen and eagerly awaiting the development of his, one day, own asset transfer and investment firm. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKev was just amazed at the image clarity of his T1 vision explorer x-range periscope. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Shenise. She thought about if she should tell Renoir she was three weeks late. If she was getting too fat. If her breasts were already too big, and too round. If Renoirs mother would ever stop looking at her like that. If she was pretty underneath it all. If she loved Renoir. If she liked Renoir. If she didn’t hate Renoir. If skin cancer was really that bad. If when she stopped and thought about it, he was really worth it anyway.  If she had imagined the glint of binoculars or a telescope nestled amongst the reeds on the brink of the  nearby sandune.\r\n\r\n",

Renoir stopped the uncomfortable thought train chugging around his mind and took up his pre-rehearsed epic speech. </p>\n<p>Elsewhere Aled tried desperately not to reveal his erection as he peered through Kevs ancient periscope at his first real life breasts, cementing an, unknown to him at the time, cripplingly unrealistic expectation of female chests that he would only get over when Alice, his 17 year old love of his life made him watch a Netflix documentary on plastic surgery and modern day female body images.  For now he merely wondered how Renoir did it; all these girls, a new one every month.</p>\n<p>Dev however was more concerned with if he would be able to hide his ejection better than Aled when it was his turn. He was under no illusions how’s Renoir did it, his father having been on the Risk end of one of Renoir’s High Risk, High Reward investment schemes that had left him thoroughly underwhelmed with his fathers business acumen and eagerly awaiting the development of his, one day, own asset transfer and investment firm. </p>\n<p>Kev was just amazed at the image clarity of his T1 vision explorer x-range periscope. </p>\n<p>And Shenise. She thought about if she should tell Renoir she was three weeks late. If she was getting too fat. If her breasts were already too big, and too round. If Renoirs mother would ever stop looking at her like that. If she was pretty underneath it all. If she loved Renoir. If she liked Renoir. If she didn’t hate Renoir. If skin cancer was really that bad. If when she stopped and thought about it, he was really worth it anyway.  If she had imagined the glint of binoculars or a telescope nestled amongst the reeds on the brink of the  nearby sandune.</p>\n"

No-one could say for sure when he first lost his mind, because nobody saw him from one month to the next. It takes a certain kind of man to lock himself away like that, people muttered, afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery few months Peter from the shop would row out across the grey-black water in his little red boat with enough supplies for the next lonely stretch. Sam, in his thick blue jersey and ever-greying beard would look away, take the basket and retreat with obvious relief into his world of mirrors and lights and infinitely winding stairs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSam was as much a fixture in the village as the lighthouse itself. The children told each other stories about him; sometimes he was a prince, sometimes a monster borrowed from a fairytale. He found relief locked in his tower, in the familiar routines and hard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich was why it came as a surprise when he first saw her, twined among his rocks and seaweed, that Sam found that he was strangely pleased. He guarded his solitude jealousy, but she was so very pretty that he didn’t even wonder how she got there, he was just glad she was there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the kind of day Sam loved - misty, grey and impenetrable. The wind was singing its familiar song around the tower, but today it seemed sadder than usual, so Sam went out to listen. That’s when he saw it - saw her, seeming somehow to belong there, so he stood and watched her for a while. She was naked and so cold she seemed almost blue. She was singing along with the wind in a language Sam didn’t know. When he looked again, she was gone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSam didn’t see her for weeks after that, but he thought about her. He thought about the way her black hair coiled around her bare shoulders and he thought about what it might feel like in his gnarled old fingers. He imagined it felt like thick, wet silk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he saw her again he hurried over, but he blinked and she was gone again. She always seemed to be gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter found him weeks later. The lighthouse door gaped open in an unhinged grin. Inside the place was a wreck; unwashed dishes, papers scattered, trailing up to the room where the light stood, grimey and neglected. The walls were streaked with filth and what looked like swirls and patterns drawn in blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the other side of the lighthouse, the side that faced the infinitely stretching sea, Peter found Sam stretched out across the rocks. He had been dead for a long time, but Peter could still see the smile of pure happiness clinging to the man’s ancient, lifeless face. His fingernails were bloody and ragged, clutching at clumps of, black, hairy seaweed as though it were coils of the finest silk... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

He used the remote in his lap to put their mouths into permanent O shapes and leave the host with teeth like a horse pulling its lips back. \r\n\r\nHe said to Mister Toby, ‘Her again, bound to be.’ He swapped the remote for the chair riser controls. ‘Well I’ll show her, this time.’\r\n\r\nThe bell was his company all the while as the chair pushed him to nearly standing and then forward into the metal walker. It rang as he shuffled over the pink roses in the carpet and it kept on sounding as he steadied himself on the door frame before lunging to the second walker in the hall. It was near permanent singing as he screwed his eye to the peephole to see that tiny face that was all strong chin and belligerent hair. \r\n\r\nAll boys together so his dressing gown wasn’t tied even at the middle. A simple dance though his shoulders and it dropped. He almost cackled – stark naked by his own front door. He cracked it a touch, opened his mouth to tell her straight but yelped instead as a colour photograph of a black cat came through the gap and began to dance up and down.\r\n\r\n‘See? Don’t you see? Put that next to your cat, it would be like a mirror.’\r\n\r\nHe put his face to the gap.\r\n\r\n‘Madam, please leave me alone. My Toby is not your cat.’\r\n\r\n‘Then they’re bloody twins!’\r\n\r\nThe photograph disappeared. The old man edged himself backwards and the door swung open a few more inches. There was a scream of triumph. ‘Archie!’\r\n\r\nMister Toby had come from the lounge and was perched in the middle of the hall watching them placidly. Through the gap now came an arm that turned into a shoulder that began to press the front door open further. The old man’s walker began to slide.\r\n\r\nHe murmured it - ‘Madam, I’m not decent.’\r\n\r\nWhen that flood of leggings and hair extensions popped through the door it sprang back from the walker to almost closed. She surged to Mister Toby with a shriek of triumph. She held the photograph down close to Toby’s face.\r\n\r\n‘See? Like a mirror!’\r\n\r\nWhen she looked at the old man she faltered. \r\n\r\n‘Oh.’ \r\n\r\nShe steeled herself. \r\n\r\n‘Oh my God, you’re one of those. You borrow women’s cats and then show them your bits.’\r\n\r\nHe pushed his walker aside and took a single tottering step closer. He lifted the panic button hung on string around his neck and showed it her.  \r\n\r\n‘I press this, they come running.’ He smiled grimly at her. ‘You want me to tell them how you stripped an old man in his own home? Made him walk around till he fell over, and then stole his cat?’\r\n\r\nNow the smile turned to malice. \r\n\r\n‘Or do you want to walk out of her and leave me and Mister Toby alone forever?’",

This place was full of cameras, but no one ever thought about the little people who could move, head held high safely hidden from sight be the counter tops and display cases. \r\n\r\nWhen her bag was full to bursting she joined the throng that were mobiles out filming the schoolboys as they whooped and turned summersaults. Emma cursed inwardly. Of course, they’d overegg it, these were circus dwarves, which explained why each of the four had a comedy roman candle bursting with fire protruding from the top of their cap. It took no persuasion to get them involved – she told them the owner of Dashwoods was prejudiced against little people and so they had donned school uniforms for pride and beer money. \r\n\r\nEmma joined the concerned onlookers who began to crowd around the homeless.

It had been several weeks since his last letter and Fanny was beginning to wonder what had become of him. Would he ever return from France to marry her and release her from the confines of her mother’s house?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMary was labouring through something dreary on the pianoforte, Lydia was polishing fork handles and suddenly Fanny found she simply couldn’t bear it. She had been trapped inside for three days by this dreadful weather with these ghastly people and all the while knowing nothing of her love’s fate. It would not do!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe stood and calmly walked out into the hall, whereupon she threw herself into a frenzy of activity. Running in her sprigged muslin to the kitchens she found the cook’s boy and slipped a shilling into his hand and a whisper into his ear. He nodded once and darted to the stables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFanny ran to her room and began dragging the ringlets from her hair. A tap at the door! It was cook’s boy with a damp bundle. He flashed a gap-toothed smile and scurried below stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInside the package were some trousers, a cap and a ragged shirt and jacket. Fanny threw the sprigged muslin to the ground and donned her the threadbare garments. She twisted her hair up into the cap and stared at herself in the glass. She barely recognised her reflection. Splendid. Then, without giving herself time to think, she ran out into the pouring rain, liberated from the trappings of her dress and filled with heady exhilaration. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe’d go to Captain McGrew. He’d find her passage to France as a ship’s boy. She ran all the way to the dockyard, stepping fearlessly over broken chains, coils of rope and mysterious puddles of matter. The air smelled thick and briney and gulls swooped overhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Captain Dick McGrew’s office Fanny rapped sharply on the door. She heard movement inside and waited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Uh, just a minute” called Captain McGrew, but Fanny couldn’t wait. She turned the handle and stepped inside:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir, I’m just a ‘umble lad looking for some ‘onest work and a bit o’ travel…”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFanny trailed off. There, in nothing but their shirt tails, stood Dick McGrew and none other than her own dear Captain Adams engaged in some very unsavoury activity. She gaped, open-mouthed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Fanny, is that you?” shouted Adams fastening his britches. “By God you look marvellous in that outfit - much better than that sprigged muslin.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFanny blushed and smiled, despite her shock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Fact is Fanny I decided to abandon the ship and make a go of it with old Dick here, but now that you’re here looking so devilishly handsome I’ve half a mind to bring you with us. What do you say Dick?” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe didn’t wait for Dick to answer, who was too busy wrestling with his own britches, but stared appealingly at Fanny. Remembering the dull tedium of her mother’s living room she agreed in an instant and the three of them set sail for India the very next day...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Max was never sure what to do when Danny got upset like this, so he stayed quiet, hoping Danny would let him have a go on the XBox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut he didn’t. He sat sulkily on the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Danny?” ventured Max. Danny stared at his Converse. They were brand new ones from America that you couldn’t even get over here. “Can I play, please?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Danny still didn’t answer Max tentatively reached for the controller. As his hand touched it Danny’s foot kicked it away so it collided with his dad’s stack of lever arch files, catching Max’s fingers in the process. He still didn’t speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ok” Max rubbed his fingers, “let’s play real-life cowboys instead? With a fort! You can be Buffalo Bill and I’ll be the Injuns?” Danny’s house was huge and had loads of great fort building materials and his parents were never home, so they wouldn’t mind if they made a mess. But Danny didn’t move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Why would we want to play like little kids? Is that what all poor people do?” He stared pointedly at Max’s grubby daps and pushed the controller out of his reach,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I don’t want you touching my things. They might get dirty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDanny often said things like this when he was upset. It was true that Danny always had the best toys and clothes and Max didn’t understand why Danny was ever cross. But he didn’t mind, he’d just go home and come back when Danny was feeling better. When he wasn’t cross, Max reminded himself, Danny was fun. He got up to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sorry Danny” Max said as he let himself out “see you at school”. He heard the computer start up again, echoing through the large, empty house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was cold out and damp and his coat was a thin one, but it his house wasn’t far -  about half an hour from Danny’s. When he got in his mum, swooped down to take off his coat and kiss him warmly. His sisters squabbled by the fire and the whole place seemed so full of noise and people that Max could hardly squeeze himself onto the sofa by his dad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You’re home early. How was Danny?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“He was ok. I think I made him cross when I said we should play real life cowboys. He said that was for little kids.” He didn’t mention what Danny had said about poor people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“But real life cowboys are the best! You could have built a fort!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMax grinned “that’s what I said!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMax’s dad grabbed the clothes horse from the kitchen and shook out the patched blanket from the end of the sofa. “Yeeehaww! Which of you varmints will help build a fort to keep out them Injuns?” At this the already crowded room became a flurry of activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt number 9 Danny’s computer sang again into the darkening room",

            "content": "Juicy Lucy Coslett naked in the mirror, twisting left then right inspecting the taut lines of her swimmer’s body. Juicy Lucy pouting, bending, hands caressing silky pink skin still shower slick, fingers creeping the taut curve of her belly, quivering closer for the tight lines of her Brazilian wax. Eyes in the mirror, eyes right into Iain’s soul, and there it was, his Big Moment, and then preparations for Big Night could resume for the third time. \r\n\r\nAfter he had put the cushions back to neatness and turned Nana’s photo on the mantelpiece round the right way.\r\n\r\nHim and Juicy Lucy together for how long was it? Nursery, so his Nana reckoned, and he remembered primary school, this blur of golden curls pretty much every one of his memories. High school the high point, both of them top set everything, time and again top girl and top boy on stage for their awards. It didn’t matter she went to unit without him, those dark twenties, they were behind them now. Him and Juicy Lucy together again at last. It was going to be perfect. \r\n\r\nThey were having duck, Gressingham duck breasts, skin lovingly massaged with fine Maldon salt, crisped to a heavenly crunch then placed – skin side up – in the oven to allow the thick layer of fat to render into a delicious sauce. He’d heard her talking, duck her favourite, but she’d never have duck like this. The bought special wine thermometer said her favourite Chardonnay was at the perfect temperature, but there was also three different kinds of foreign beer because he was sure he’d heard her mention it just as the lift doors closed. \r\n\r\nThe dining room was already perfect, Nana’s best china and cutlery, and obviously pride of place given to her hand crocheted placements she saved for best. \r\n\r\nIain took himself up to his Nana’s room and stood in front of her full length mirror. He was already the man in black, everything dull black, nothing that reflects. He had a pot of black camouflage paint into which he dipped two fingers then began to draw circles around his eyes. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nLucy Coslett did own a full length of mirror but the only naked it reflected was a blur as she scurried past. Still enough for those honking great horns of cellulite to sound, and that flabby mess around her middle despite the yoga. She only stood full length in front of the mirror fully clothed, and even then – God – this top with these jeans, how paunchy did they make her look?\r\n\r\nWhen the doorbell chimed she flew, slowing at the last step, counting to six by the front door. When the bell rang again she opened the door. Duncan grinned back at her. He raised both shopping laden arms aloft. Before he’d even set the bags on the kitchen counter she snuck the wine. \r\n\r\n‘Chilled already, you wonderful man!’\r\n\r\nThe first decent gulp of Chardonnay began to work its magic. \r\n\r\n‘God, I need this,’ Lucy said. ‘After the week I’ve had.’ \r\n\r\n‘He’s still, uh…?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh God, yes. That man gives me the creeps. The way he-‘\r\n\r\nShe paused, bright light streaming through the gaps in the kitchen curtains from the outside security light. \r\n\r\n‘Probably a cat,’ she said.\r\n\r\n‘Or a fox.’\r\n\r\nThe light went out. \r\n\r\nDuncan said, ‘The way he…?’\r\n\r\nShe shuddered as she gulped more wine.\r\n\r\n‘Everyone knows when I shut my office door I’m changing for the gym, or for court. He knocks, then a nanosecond later he’s pushing his stupid little mail cart through, I swear he-‘\r\n\r\nThe light came on again. \r\n\r\n‘Bloody thing,’ Lucy said. She reached behind the curtain and switched off the light. She smiled at Duncan. ‘No more interruptions. Right, where were we?’\r\n\r\nDuncan sipped his own wine. \r\n\r\n‘You were telling me about Dodgy Iain, how he’s started bursting in unexpectedly…’\r\n\r\n",

The caravan looked and smelled like 15 years in a dark damp forest. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe sat staring out, trying to figure out why he was still there and if he could leave yet. And if he did, then what? He supposed it had been love. Whatever that was. Something inside him that had taken over and stripped sense and reason from him. Or maybe that was just an excuse. He rolled the bottom of his beer across the table in small circles before almost knocking it off clumsily. He sighed and finished the bottle, picking his crochet up and trying again. The hook caught and he cursed silently. Another stupid idea; he just couldn’t get the hang of it. Tom would have been great at this he thought. He was one of those people who was instantly good at everything he turned his hand to. The thought darkened his gloom and he tossed the mess of wool into the corner. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe air was thick with the heaviness of a summer storm. He picked up a book from a shelf at random and immediately discarded it. The stifling air added to his mood, frustrated, he wanted to get out and walk, but the rain was as torrential as his thoughts. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe wondered for the 1000th time what Tom was doing, if he was thinking about him at all. It had been crazy to do it. The heat. The music. The buzz. It had all been too much. He remembered how his hand had felt numb when they touched. How his lips were rough and tasted of cheap lager.  How long ago was that? Funny how one short moment can so completely divide time; before and after. Nothing was the same after. Can I ever go back to before? He thought. Fuck this. Fuck love. Fuck tom. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHe lay down on the bed replaying the day after. He’d woken up, packed a bag and driven straight here, firing off a quick email about a family emergency to work. They used to come out here drinking, hunting in the forest. Enjoying nature.  The rain had died down briefly a pause in the storm. He grabbed a beer and headed outside. The air was warm and the soft rain was refreshing against his bare chest. He stood silent. Watching nothing. A faint rustle in the undergrowth and his heart froze. He didn’t dare to hope, but there it was anyway. A small perhaps. Maybe. The undergrowth moved again and from the shadows a large canine shape padded into the moonlight. An old fox, faded fur but still beautiful. It looked at him slowly, deep green eyes passing judgment. Then seeing nothing of note it looked away and padded across the grass into the distant undergrowth.  Nothing to worry you here he thought. Nothing but a sad fool, waiting. Waiting. Trapped between before and after. Unwilling to go forward. Unable to go back. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

In the photograph she was looking at him and he stared straight ahead, seriously down the lense, straight into her eyes now, today, while her picture’s gaze drank him in, soaked up every inch of him with youthful passion. In the picture her long dark hair blew out around her head, wildly and she looked almost pretty. It had been a windy day, but she felt the warmth of it fill her up from her toes and she squirmed with excitement at the thought of when she’d see him next. Maybe tonight? Probably tonight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was the day they’d gone to the beach. Ben drove and they had ice cream and she’d paddled in the sea. She’d never been to the beach before, but Ben had, hundreds of times. That’s why he didn’t run with her down to the water with her, or find her dark hair’s contrast against the fine white sand quite so fascinating. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was probably why he had forgotten the pretty shells she found for him - it wasn’t new to him; it was like someone running up to her and excitedly presenting her with an old bus ticket or, or, or a handful of gravel or something. She laughed at her own naivete .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one of the only photographs he’d let her take with the two of them in together. Ben hated having his photograph taken, she knew, so she hardly ever asked. But this day she couldn’t help it and couldn’t believe her luck when he agreed. A man walking past with his dog kindly stopped and wound up her cheap disposable camera and click! There they were, frozen together in time. She smiled and looked again at the phone on the bedside table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey’d gone home to her shabby little flat and had a meal of pasta with a jar of shop-bought ragu. They’d made love quickly in front of the little gas heater, but Ben hadn’t stayed. He had to go to work in the morning. She understood, he never stayed over. But soon he’d invite her up to see his flat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly the phone rang and her heart soared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ben! I’ve been waiting for you to ring, how are you?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“No, mum, it’s not Ben, it’s me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh.” Disappointment. “Who are you?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It’s me, mum.” Resignation. “Ruth? Your daughter? I was hoping to come up and see you today - would you like that?” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh. Ruth. I see.” She didn’t see, but she didn’t want to seem rude. “Only I’ve been waiting for Ben to ring, so I’d better get off the phone, in case he can’t get through.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGently she put down the receiver with a slight click and picked up the photograph again. Her hair fell long and white and thinning around her shoulders and her hands shook with age as she stared at the picture. It had been a beautiful day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I’ve been waiting for you to ring, how are you?”</p>\n<p>“No, mum, it’s not Ben, it’s me.”</p>\n<p>“Oh.” Disappointment. “Who are you?”</p>\n<p>“It’s me, mum.” Resignation. “Ruth? Your daughter? I was hoping to come up and see you today - would you like that?” </p>\n<p>“Oh. Ruth. I see.” She didn’t see, but she didn’t want to seem rude. “Only I’ve been waiting for Ben to ring, so I’d better get off the phone, in case he can’t get through.”</p>\n<p>Gently she put down the receiver with a slight click and picked up the photograph again. Her hair fell long and white and thinning around her shoulders and her hands shook with age as she stared at the picture. It had been a beautiful day.</p>\n"

He’d always relied on a body of contemporary mates, The Desperate Brothers, Duncan Disorganised and Annie Doolittle, the whole lower half of the 80s Alternative comedy bill basically. \r\n\r\nHe’d turn up in the illicit all night bar run by a mate in Circus Field Camping after all the shows were done and someone would buy him a drink. \r\n\r\nThis year, none of them seemed to be there, it was all young people. He’d had to spend more of his own money than he had planned for and now had nothing left but a fiver and some loose change.  \r\n\r\nHis body felt tired from all the trudging in mud and his show, at two pm in the comedy tent, had, sadly,  taken place in this year’s one brief three hour period when it wasn’t raining. His hoped for wet weather bonus of a packed house of shelterers, was replaced by 12 students, sleeping or on their phones and nobody, least of all him was listening to what he was saying. \r\n\r\nHe’d been to the Circus Green Room and danced to Ranking Roger’s Beat in a desperate attempt to show himself as a free spirit who didn’t need company but then his back started to hurt. “If there’s a smile on my face it’s only there trying to fool the public” sang Roger as he left. Everyone’s an ironic, observational comedian these days he thought. \r\n\r\n he’d been woken three hours later at 6am,  by a desperate need for a piss and had rushed out his tent only behold the hideous sight of  Octogenarian Actor,  Dudley Sutton, Tinker Dill out of Lovejoy, stark bollock naked in front of his own tent in the gathering dawn. \r\n\r\nAt this point he realised he was stark bollock naked too.\r\n\r\n“Morning!” said Dudley Sutton cheerily as the both relieved themselves onto opposing pieces of mud. He scowled back and wondered why the old fool still bothered.  \r\n\r\nThat could have been another funny sketch but he was too miserable to notice it. \r\n\r\nAnd now, a few years later Dudley Sutton was dead and Ranking Roger had cancer. \r\n\r\nAnd he had given up comedy because he actually didn’t find anything funny anymore. \r\n\r\nHe’d moved house, sold his flat in London, moved back to Cardiff, with the mortgage paid off and now worked in a nice Wellfield Rd café, where no one knew he’d once been a comedian on the telly, apart from a very rare, “Didn’t you used to be”.\r\n\r\n He was happier than he’d been in years! For unlike Dudley Sutton who lived his whole life inside showbiz and was always bound to die there. He’d taken up comedy to waste time one summer and it had become a job like any other. \r\n\r\nAnd now it was time to do something else. \r\n\r\n  ",

He’d always relied on a body of contemporary mates, The Desperate Brothers, Duncan Disorganised and Annie Doolittle, the whole lower half of the 80s Alternative comedy bill basically. </p>\n<p>He’d turn up in the illicit all night bar run by a mate in Circus Field Camping after all the shows were done and someone would buy him a drink. </p>\n<p>This year, none of them seemed to be there, it was all young people. He’d had to spend more of his own money than he had planned for and now had nothing left but a fiver and some loose change.  </p>\n<p>His body felt tired from all the trudging in mud and his show, at two pm in the comedy tent, had, sadly,  taken place in this year’s one brief three hour period when it wasn’t raining. His hoped for wet weather bonus of a packed house of shelterers, was replaced by 12 students, sleeping or on their phones and nobody, least of all him was listening to what he was saying. </p>\n<p>He’d been to the Circus Green Room and danced to Ranking Roger’s Beat in a desperate attempt to show himself as a free spirit who didn’t need company but then his back started to hurt. “If there’s a smile on my face it’s only there trying to fool the public” sang Roger as he left. Everyone’s an ironic, observational comedian these days he thought. </p>\n<p> he’d been woken three hours later at 6am,  by a desperate need for a piss and had rushed out his tent only behold the hideous sight of  Octogenarian Actor,  Dudley Sutton, Tinker Dill out of Lovejoy, stark bollock naked in front of his own tent in the gathering dawn. </p>\n<p>At this point he realised he was stark bollock naked too.</p>\n<p>“Morning!” said Dudley Sutton cheerily as the both relieved themselves onto opposing pieces of mud. He scowled back and wondered why the old fool still bothered.  </p>\n<p>That could have been another funny sketch but he was too miserable to notice it. </p>\n<p>And now, a few years later Dudley Sutton was dead and Ranking Roger had cancer. </p>\n<p>And he had given up comedy because he actually didn’t find anything funny anymore. </p>\n<p>He’d moved house, sold his flat in London, moved back to Cardiff, with the mortgage paid off and now worked in a nice Wellfield Rd café, where no one knew he’d once been a comedian on the telly, apart from a very rare, “Didn’t you used to be”.</p>\n<p> He was happier than he’d been in years! For unlike Dudley Sutton who lived his whole life inside showbiz and was always bound to die there. He’d taken up comedy to waste time one summer and it had become a job like any other. </p>\n<p>And now it was time to do something else. </p>\n"

At first she’d thought he’d just zoned out in her general direction, but his eyes followed her lickerishly, unblinking; leg jiggling, hand unseen, breathing fast through an open mouth. Steph squirmed in her seat. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree stops. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside it was dark, late. Rain trickled sadly down the windows and the harsh fluorescent light inside the bus illuminated Steph’s reflection in the glass. The last bus. Sometimes she felt she spent most of her life here, scrabbling for loose change, avoiding the weirdos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe took in her pale skin, the circles under her eyes and the hopelessness behind them, before realising she could also see the man behind her, still staring, still jiggling. His t-shirt was stained, and his jeans were torn, his age indeterminate. His coat was draped over his lap, hands submerged beneath. Steph felt sick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bus stopped, but nobody else got on. Behind the softly lit curtained windows were families, tucked up in bed or watching Lovejoy or Antiques Roadshow reruns. Being together. Steph thought of her own damp beige flat and envied their warm banality. Then the bus inhaled loudly, like a builder assessing dry rot, and pulled off. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo stops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Steph got off the bus she knew, without turning, that the man was behind her. She could hear his wet breathing and the lurch of his uneven stride on the pavement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon’t look, keep walking. It went through her head like a mantra. Under the streetlights his shadow fell long reminding her how close he was, how tall and lumbering. He could overpower her in a heartbeat. She clutched her keys, jagged edge poking out, ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs she neared her flat she quickened her pace. He did too. The keys felt slippery in her hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve doors and she was home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Excuse me” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere it was. His voice was low, with the slurred speech of a practised drinker. She pretended she didn’t hear. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFour doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You...you left your phone on the bus, but I’ve got it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe felt in her pocket. Her phone wasn’t there. She looked and he was holding it out to her with hands that shook and juddered almost uncontrollably. She glanced at the man’s face. His eyes were screwed up, jaw set in concentration, forcing himself to hold steady. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as she took it he plunged his hands deep into his trouser pockets with relief. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Thank you. I really appreciate this.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’m s...sorry if I scared you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteph could hear the stammer in his voice, the concentration it seemed to take just to stand still and speak to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Was this your stop?” she asked. The man shook his head. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You mean you got off just to give me the phone? How are you going to get home?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe shrugged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well at least let me make you a cup of tea. To say thanks?” For the first time the man met her eyes, just for a second, and smiled warmly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as Steph took two mugs from the cupboard instead of one, her damp beige flat suddenly didn’t seem so lonely after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

She was looking incredulous.\r\n\r\n‘Lovejoy?’\r\n\r\n‘It’s a good one, apparently. An unsavoury stranger comes to the village and Tinker finds a rare coin in his loose change.’\r\n\r\n‘Lovejoy??’\r\n\r\n‘That TV programme, with the antiques dealer.’\r\n\r\n‘I know what Lovejoy is! She’s not going to watch her first grandson in his first football game because of a thirty-year-old show about some dodgy geezer with an even dodgier mullet?’\r\n\r\nA few days later I had a brainwave. I did next day delivery, Lou wrapped it and then we went around there together. Mum insisted on making the tea, despite the present wrapped up in gaudy paper on her coffee table. She dithered in the kitchen, some of the water eventually making its way into the teapot, and only then did I get her back into the lounge.\r\n\r\nShe regarded the gift doubtfully. \r\n\r\n‘Is it my birthday already? Where’s the rest of the presents?’\r\n\r\n‘It’s a little spontaneous gift,’ I said. ‘Do you want me to open it?’\r\n\r\nI flinched in the full glare of that Mum stare that was straight out of forty years ago. Lou stifled a snort. \r\n\r\nMum rose and fetched a pair of nail scissors from the sideboard. Very carefully, she cut the pieces of Sellotape, unwrapped the gift and then began to fold the wrapping for reuse. \r\n\r\nI held out the present to her. It was a DVD boxset. \r\n\r\nI said, ‘It’s every single episode of Lovejoy. Now you can watch it whenever you want.’\r\n\r\nShe peered at the picture of the cast on the back.\r\n\r\n‘Don’t they all look so young. He’s dead now, you know, Tinker, the sidekick who wore the beret.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, but in here, he lives on. You can watch them on the DVD player we got you for Christmas.’\r\n\r\n‘That’s nice dear. Tea?’\r\n\r\nI said, ‘Mum, Friday evening, Georgie has a school play. Will you come?’\r\n\r\n‘Friday? Oh, I can’t do that. Your father and I never miss Lovejoy.’\r\n\r\nLou and I looked at each other. She shook her head, pointing at me as if to say, “your mum”. \r\n\r\nEver so gently, I said, ‘Dad’s not with us anymore.’\r\n\r\nMum treated me to a withering look. \r\n\r\n‘Do I look that dotty? Of course, I know your father’s dead. But we always said, no matter where we were, if Lovejoy was on we’d watch it together. So that’s what we do. We settle down and we watch Lovejoy.’\r\n\r\nI took hold of Mum’s hands.

            "content": "The screen flickers, hisses, buzzes, flickers once brightly and then finally closes its eyes for ever. You should probably contact ITC. Except to do that you have to raise a ticket. On the computer. With the broken screen. Instead you wander over to the coffee machine and scramble through your pockets for any loose change. Hot water 5p. Tea and Coffee 30p. You have 27p of course. Sighing you wander back to your desk. This is it now. This is everything. All day. Every day. Just slowly unravelling like your favourite cotton jumper caught on a loose nail of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou try and remember the alleged wild youthful days everyone had, as you add another layer to the robot drawing your scribbling on your 3pm meeting agenda. But nothing comes up, you can’t remember when those days happened, if they even did. Everyone said their twenties were wild. But when you think about it, when you had actual legitimate fun all you can picture are flashes of scenes from television. You remember being hungover of course. So you know you defiantly drank a lot. Other than that it’s like trying to remember a concert you didn’t go to by someone else describing it. It all sounds great but your not convinced it happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou remember starting here, how much you wanted to be different, a debonoir Lovejoy character; footloose wangling deals left right and centre, doing things your own way.  Now look at yourself stuck self narrating your own dishevelled mundane life. Wishing you’d bought the next size up trousers. Wondering if you should need the toilet this often. Hoping someone else can come along and change your life for you, because you’ve forgotten how.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou check your phone for the 12th time. She hasn’t messaged back. Of course. What would you do if she actually did? Probably keel over with heart failure, it’s probably about time for your first heart attack. If you didn’t die it might at least pay off the mortgage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides she was top of everyone’s ‘partner list’, understandably. She was intelligent, funny, hardworking, and stunning but not over the top; subtle, the dream partner. You might have had a chance, if this was three years ago, full of energy and vision for the company now you are just another unsavoury stranger to her. You staple a post-it note to the mouse mat. Just because.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen your phone flashes. You’ve turned off notifications on your Clash of Clans game, and your fantasy football app. No one else ever texts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou stand up. Look away towards the lifts to the fourth floor where she will be sat, or probably stood demanding something important of someone down the phone. Maybe. Maybe she saw something in you. A glimpse of what you could have been; the elusive potential, that is so sought after and so rarely achieved. You grab another secret biscuit from the draw. Triple chocolate this week. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou reach out and pick up the phone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi, remember it’s your dental appointment on 01/03/19 at 14:45. If you can’t make this, please call us to rearrange. Thanks.\r\n\r\n",

Except to do that you have to raise a ticket. On the computer. With the broken screen. Instead you wander over to the coffee machine and scramble through your pockets for any loose change. Hot water 5p. Tea and Coffee 30p. You have 27p of course. Sighing you wander back to your desk. This is it now. This is everything. All day. Every day. Just slowly unravelling like your favourite cotton jumper caught on a loose nail of life.</p>\n<p>You try and remember the alleged wild youthful days everyone had, as you add another layer to the robot drawing your scribbling on your 3pm meeting agenda. But nothing comes up, you can’t remember when those days happened, if they even did. Everyone said their twenties were wild. But when you think about it, when you had actual legitimate fun all you can picture are flashes of scenes from television. You remember being hungover of course. So you know you defiantly drank a lot. Other than that it’s like trying to remember a concert you didn’t go to by someone else describing it. It all sounds great but your not convinced it happened.</p>\n<p>You remember starting here, how much you wanted to be different, a debonoir Lovejoy character; footloose wangling deals left right and centre, doing things your own way.  Now look at yourself stuck self narrating your own dishevelled mundane life. Wishing you’d bought the next size up trousers. Wondering if you should need the toilet this often. Hoping someone else can come along and change your life for you, because you’ve forgotten how.</p>\n<p>You check your phone for the 12th time. She hasn’t messaged back. Of course. What would you do if she actually did? Probably keel over with heart failure, it’s probably about time for your first heart attack. If you didn’t die it might at least pay off the mortgage.</p>\n<p>Besides she was top of everyone’s ‘partner list’, understandably. She was intelligent, funny, hardworking, and stunning but not over the top; subtle, the dream partner. You might have had a chance, if this was three years ago, full of energy and vision for the company now you are just another unsavoury stranger to her. You staple a post-it note to the mouse mat. Just because.</p>\n<p>Then your phone flashes. You’ve turned off notifications on your Clash of Clans game, and your fantasy football app. No one else ever texts. </p>\n<p>You stand up. Look away towards the lifts to the fourth floor where she will be sat, or probably stood demanding something important of someone down the phone. Maybe. Maybe she saw something in you. A glimpse of what you could have been; the elusive potential, that is so sought after and so rarely achieved. You grab another secret biscuit from the draw. Triple chocolate this week. </p>\n<p>You reach out and pick up the phone. </p>\n<p>Hi, remember it’s your dental appointment on 01/03/19 at 14:45. If you can’t make this, please call us to rearrange. Thanks.</p>\n"

Martin was there, definitely; she remembered holding him a while. Then haziness - had he been in the bed with her? Katie wasn’t sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe’d have to tell the kids. The thought dropped into the pit of her stomach, like a rock into a river. She’d promised them that this time it would be different. Christ, she’d done everything she could to make it different. She hadn’t brought him home until she was certain that they were all ready for this, that he wouldn’t run off, like the others. She’d thought he’d been happy with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, just like that, he was gone. Katie felt the crushing sense of failure again. She heard voices in the next room. She had two minutes max to wriggle out of last night’s dress and into her pyjamas. Act normal, she told herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then they were there. Annabel, seven, carrying her library book to read in bed and Thomas, four, dragging Blanky behind him. They jumped into bed with Katie, who gathered them up in her arms. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen she felt Annabel stiffen. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Mum? Where’s Martin?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Annabelle, love…”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You said this time was different. You said he’d stay.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKatie felt their eyes on her, Annabelle accusing, Thomas sad, confused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Kids, I’m sorry…”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKatie’s eyes filled with tears. Great, she was going to cry in front of the kids. Again. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnabel left in disgust. Thomas, however, stayed. He put his arms around her and snuggled close. That helped. She kissed his head and pulled herself together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Right, who wants eggs and soldiers?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHand in hand they went downstairs. While the kids ate Katie decided that activity would best cure her hangover. A fresh start. A clean house. She pulled the hoover from the cupboard and plugged it in. The noise filled the room and her aching head, but it was a cleansing pain - she was starting to feel better. Then she looked up and saw that Thomas was pointing at something on the floor. It was small and furry and scurrying, but Katie was looking at her son and she missed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Mummy? I just saw Martin - he ran out from under the sofa! Look! He’s there, on the carpet! He’s ok after all!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKatie couldn’t hear over the hoover, so she smiled and nodded, to please him. But Thomas’  face was distressed now, his hands waving, so Katie moved to turn off the hoover. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then the hoover made a thick, choking sound, like when it inhaled socks. Only this felt like an exceptionally heavy sock. Thick.

            "content": "All's Fair\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHolding hands they waded, dreamlike, through the crowds. The wind sniped vindictively at any exposed flesh, slipping between the wool of scarves and jumpers and pummelling their cheeks to red-raw rosiness, forcing blushes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDucking through candyfloss clouds and bustling families they made for the ferris wheel, he leading, laughing; she following, impossibly young inside her painted-on adulthood. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had met in Maths last year. Three weeks later and she was scratching his name into her pencil case and practising cliches with her girlfriends in the school yard. Here they stood, nearly a year on, queueing together for the ferris wheel, glitter-eyed. Love’s young dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBalloons punctuated the winter night, drifting bubbles of red and yellow and silver-blue, clutched by muffled and mittened children. And all around the lights from the rides slashed at the darkness to rip it apart and reveal the life hidden within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey stumbled excitedly into the seats, his hands guiding, insistent. He touched his jacket pocket repeatedly, checking, uncertain, determined. She suspected nothing. Good, he wanted the surprise. That would make it special.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe creaky ascent began. She feigned fright. He donned protectiveness like a cloak to wrap around them both and pointed out the sights, while she pretended to tremble and drank in the warmth and smell of his closeness. In the icy darkness they assumed their designated roles, her hands finding homes in the creases of his shirt; his stubble grazing her hair like velcro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the top, she was shocked to find that her feigned fright was suddenly startlingly real.

The wind sniped vindictively at any exposed flesh, slipping between the wool of scarves and jumpers and pummelling their cheeks to red-raw rosiness, forcing blushes. </p>\n<p>Ducking through candyfloss clouds and bustling families they made for the ferris wheel, he leading, laughing; she following, impossibly young inside her painted-on adulthood. </p>\n<p>They had met in Maths last year. Three weeks later and she was scratching his name into her pencil case and practising cliches with her girlfriends in the school yard. Here they stood, nearly a year on, queueing together for the ferris wheel, glitter-eyed. Love’s young dream.</p>\n<p>Balloons punctuated the winter night, drifting bubbles of red and yellow and silver-blue, clutched by muffled and mittened children. And all around the lights from the rides slashed at the darkness to rip it apart and reveal the life hidden within.</p>\n<p>They stumbled excitedly into the seats, his hands guiding, insistent. He touched his jacket pocket repeatedly, checking, uncertain, determined. She suspected nothing. Good, he wanted the surprise. That would make it special.</p>\n<p>The creaky ascent began. She feigned fright. He donned protectiveness like a cloak to wrap around them both and pointed out the sights, while she pretended to tremble and drank in the warmth and smell of his closeness. In the icy darkness they assumed their designated roles, her hands finding homes in the creases of his shirt; his stubble grazing her hair like velcro.</p>\n<p>At the top, she was shocked to find that her feigned fright was suddenly startlingly real. She gripped him in earnest now, quelling the rushing in her stomach, the panic inching its way to her fingertips. She could hold it together if he could hold her and keep their little world still and safe. </p>\n<p>But he was fumbling now, reaching into his pocket, rocking the little car that hung so high and so precariously... </p>\n<p>She tried not to cling - her affected dependency transformed into a desperate, clawing thing that she strove to conceal with fluttering eyelashes and bambi eyes, but he wasn’t paying attention anyway.

We got straight to work on it with sledgehammers and crowbars, wrenching down plasterboard, prising up floorboards to see if they hid original tiles or intricate woodwork. There were one or two special finds, but mainly it was rubbish, but we didn’t mind, it was what we’d expected.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Holly? I’ve found something” Chris’ voice from upstairs. He sounded excited. I ran up the stairs two at a time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“It’s a door” he told me, pointing “It was papered over, but I think there might be another room on the other side of the wall.”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Only one way to find out.” I twisted the handle. To my utter surprise it opened.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“This is the worst horror film ever.” Chris said “really, we shouldn’t have been able to open that door at all until one night, when the house is all silent and you’re alone and you hear mysterious footsteps, and then…”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Shut up” I punched him lightly on the arm and went in.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was a child’s bedroom – pink elephant wallpaper, old-fashioned toys lined up on shelves and a built-in cupboard with height measurements pencilled on the door. But, strangely, no windows. It was gloomy and dust swirled to life around us; motes swarming like flies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“It’s bleak” I said. “Not sure what we’d use this for...”\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSomething was definitely weird. Who puts a child in a windowless box room? I shuddered, backing out.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“Let’s worry about it later. It’s getting dark now anyway” Chris was unsettled too, I could tell. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we went downstairs for tinned pineapple with condensed milk amid the rubble on the kitchen floor. We talked about all of the things we could do with our new home; I wanted a library. Chris, a music room. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I slept badly that night. I dreamed I was alone in the house and, like Chris had teased, there were sounds coming from that little room. Only they weren’t footsteps; they were screams. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Chris and I, in a bid to prove we weren’t afraid, decided to tackle it right away. We spent the morning hacking plaster and ripping out skirting, breaking for lunch with a dusty sandwich and a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cupboard actually took up a lot of the space, so once we’d got the doors off we had to work our way through another layer of plasterboard before we reached the brickwork. The dust was unbearable - I touched Chris on the back to signal that I was popping out for a minute to catch my breath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of that room it was airy and light. I began to relax in the sun that streamed in cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I heard Chris gasp and drop his hammer loudly on the floor.

How many more lives would she have to pick apart trying to find out who did this to them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe slipped her hand into her pocket and brought out a silver hip flask engraved with a crested grebe and wrapped in a plastic evidence bag. It had been next to the body of the last girl and Ragna knew she’d seen the emblem somewhere before. She’d wrapped it carefully and squirreled it away before forensics had arrived. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’d come back to bite her on the ass, she knew, but she needed time to think. He was usually so careful. This didn’t make sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the fourth girl. All of them killed the exact same way. Bloody, brutal and slow. The killer enjoyed himself, took his time and Ragna knew it was a him. A man who liked to see women suffer. A man so meticulous that no trace of him was ever found.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf only she could think clearly. The cold was biting into her, dulling her thoughts; she couldn’t remember the last time she’d slept for more than a few hours together. She thought back to the people she had spoken to. The fathers, the boyfriends, the weeping best friends. Did any of them stand out? Had anything they’d said seemed wrong? Why was the damned bird so familiar?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe needed to get inside. The darkness and the snow had begun to fall quickly, heavily, blanketing the harbour. She ducked into the nearest illuminated doorway. It was one of her regular drinking spots and Ragna sat at her usual seat at the bar. She nodded to Hjörtur, the barman, and he brought her two fingers of whisky with his customary silent bonhomie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a dive. The floor was sticky with spilled beer and drunks nursed their spirits in filthy corners. Hjörtur pored miserably over a crossword, lank hair falling over his skinny face. But it was warm and there was whisky. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the girls had been well off, from good families and young - no older than sixteen. Strangely the lab had reported that first three had all eaten the same meal, just before they died - white fish in a spicy sauce, potatoes and green vegetables. All had drunk champagne too - what sort of establishment would serve them alcohol? They were children for chrissakes and the rules in Reykjavik are strict, you could lose your license serving booze to under 20s. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCould they have been on a date? An older man with influence, perhaps? Ragna made a note to check the menus of every restaurant in Reykjavik to see who served this particular menu regularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she stood up to go to the ladies Ragna didn’t see the Hjörtur’s eyes flick up from his puzzle and follow her with avaricious eyes. And when she returned to order a second double and ask for a packet of matches, he brought the whisky and lit her cigarette himself with a silver lighter, embossed with a crested grebe.\r\n\r\n",

It did not matter which way he forced himself to sleep, when he awoke he was always facing the sun, as though some deep instinctual part of his mind knew to never turn his back on this enemy that seared his eyes and burned his skin. \r\n\r\nFrom his bag he took the bottle of Crested Grebe and poured himself a measure. This was the one burn he enjoyed, because it was his choice to inflict it upon himself. He settled himself cross legged, took up his reader and connected the power cable. He lay it face down upon his thighs, waiting for that moment, that tingle, as the bonds of the interface formed themselves into the ridges and bumps of the living tactile interface. \r\n\r\nHe inserted the storage card and felt another tingle as the device quivered again.

She put them on the memory card together with puzzles and crosswords and number games. When she felt able, on nights when the moon was behind the clouds her parents would take her to enjoy some fresh night air, under cover of the pergola they had blanketed with canvas.\r\n\r\nIt had been many weeks since he found a memory card stuck under one of the chairs with a piece of gum. \r\n\r\nHe began to read her earliest letter. She talked of Iceland, a country that sometimes only saw five hours of daylight, imagine it! \r\n\r\nHe had thought about places like that, longing for the cool and the dark, but five hours of daylight could not compare with his life down here in the always dark.\r\n\r\n",

Silence. 60 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen it fades back in, first out here on the edges, the opening lines of the city orchestra plucked by the frail fingers of the fringes, then growing, swelling, picking up volume, heading back to the centre, until the full roar of Vegas is recalled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople go on about their business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the city, fortunes spin, tumble, flash past and drop. Stakes raised. Lives razed. The absence of noise barely noted in the onslaught of every day acoustics. Only a few even remember now, why it tolls, but they aren’t here in the heat and fever of the city. To most it’s just another show; The 60 seconds of silence. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut some still do. ‘Old, grey eared fools’ as they’re called. In the lonely unwashed fringes of the city they come and gather by the last real tree in the state. Hoping to see one last Cherry appear.  A fruit, bright and beautiful. And though no one remembers the taste anymore, they bring pictures, or draw a Cherry in the dust. If you look closely you may even find a faded X here and there. The tree of course does not bare fruit. But they gather still, to remember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those 60 seconds they can sit in absolute silence and let their thoughts drift back, to that evening when Rylan, the Blossom of Nevada, lit by a single spotlight,  on the final night of his 6000 day run at the Bellagio, in front of the gathered thousands, sang out, one last single pure note, held for 60 seconds, before dissipating, into a shimmer of glitter and fake cherrry blossom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was said to be a performance so beautiful, a final note so distinct and pure and absolute, that no other sound would ever recapture the beauty.  Of his evaporation, some claimed Nevana, others PR, but the great minds of Vegas did not miss a beat and set to work creating the scientific marvel that is the silence clock tower; to honour a moment that could never be recreated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course never is a dirty word in Vegas and honour, just a fallacy. Eventually the 60 seconds of silence became the attraction itself.  Then a nuisance.  Then it was another unnoticed part of the daily routine. A pause in the synthetic symphony, nothing more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, still these many years later, when others have forgotten why the silence sings, and though those that do have been discarded to the small edges; too poor to retire to the coast, to tired of the flash of the lights and the dance of fate, they meet here. A quiet little suburb. Nothing special. With a small garden. Near where a young man from England once came. They sit, in the muted bliss, under the original Cherry tree that inspired his hit song ‘You can be my Cherry and I’ll be your tree’ and remember that moment that changed the face of music.",

And you live five doors down, with Stefan your folk-singer boyfriend! </p>\n<p>Amber, our daughter was fourth in the X Factor and has sung in the West End! Stefan probably earns peanuts and dresses like a tramp!!</p>\n<p>But if I talked about her you’d dismiss her as beneath you somehow!!!</p>\n<p>If you actually talked at all! </p>\n<p>I have tried to mention the weather three times!!!  And you are just sitting there with your eyes closed!!  </p>\n<p>And you turned down the free cava we offered!!</p>\n<p>I’ve got to say I’ve no idea how of all the salons in all the world, you came here, to Cut and Dried!?!? </p>\n<p>Anyway Shelagh I’m all done, </p>\n<p>“Have it on me love! I hope you enjoy the bald look!!??” </p>\n<p>You stare at yourself dumbly and then hurry from the shop, still without a word, but maybe in tears …and I feel a little bad.   </p>\n<p>But still angry!!!  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Shelagh got home, having run back to her car crying. She’d forgotten the Pergola she’d gone all that way to get. </p>\n<p>She’d realised who it was straightaway but couldn’t remember her name. She should have left then. </p>\n<p>But instead she had pretended to be asleep. </p>\n<p>Why? </p>\n<p>She had been subjected to out and out physical abuse, the kind of thing that would have incensed her when she had worked at the women’s refuge. </p>\n<p>Now though she got her woolly hat out and put it on. </p>\n<p>And after much gnashing of teeth and impotent outrage from Stefan they had both just decided to accept what had happened.</p>\n<p>Because deep down she felt guilty that her differences looked so much like entitlement.   </p>\n"

I took the wrong turn at Dartford tunnel.”  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe driver walked around to the back of the van and opened up the door.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hello, luv!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRylan looked around but couldn’t see anyone there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It’s only me.

You’re Cilla Black!”\r\n\r\n“You alright, chuck?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’m alright, but I think your bush needs a trim,” Rylan grinned as Cilla continued hacking away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Welcome to the street.  I think it would be lovely for you to meet some of the others.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Others?” Rylan’s smile dropped and he looked confused.  “What others?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“People like us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Us? What, like utterly fabulous celebrities you mean?” Rylan replied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I mean ….” Cilla was interrupted by the telephone ringing. “I have to go, but I can get the gang together later.”  Cilla ran into the house shouting “We’ll be around at 8!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRylan sighed and walked away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter making sure most of his dining room furniture was correctly placed, the doorbell chimed and Rylan looked at the clock; it was 8.00pm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpening the door, he was greeted by Cilla Black who held a bottle of champagne in each hand.  She moved to the side to make way for a line of people who proceeded to march into the hallway.  One by one, Rylan recognised some of the faces as they walked in carrying gifts and nodding a quick hello to as they passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRylan smiled a wide-toothed grin as Freddie Mercury, Esther Rantzen, Shane McGowan and Janet Street-Porter shuffled into the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCilla was the last in and turned to Rylan as she handed him the champagne.  “We’re gonna have a lorra, lorra laughs chuck!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRylan couldn’t stop smiling.

            "title": "In the dressing room",
            "content": "\r\n\r\nThe old woman had been the worst; her cold rubbery fingers and skin bunched and grey and wrinkled, like wizened fruit around her eyes. She had kept her wages stashed in an old sock and never spent them on anything, not even new shoes when her toes were sticking out of the old ones. Then had come that awful fat man with the sinus problems. Angela had had to bite her tongue whenever his thick fingers had chanced a caress on her skin as he moved to straighten her tutu or rearrange a flounce of tulle on her costume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe procession of wardrobe assistants had always been varied at the Grand, but since Angela had been there it had felt like a different one every week. As soon as she grew used to the rancid breath and clammy fingers of one, along came another with hairy palms or some kind of facial curiosity. They were never just normal people, Angela mused. But then, what normal person would want to work backstage at the Grand every night for pennies? They wouldn’t, she decided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil Jacob had arrived. She and the other ballet girls had huddled, shivering into the dressing room to be pulled and squeezed and pinched into their costumes and there he’d been, all smiles and winks. He was young, just a few years older than Angela, and eager to prove himself. The thin strip of dark brown hair dusting his upper lip showed that. Angela thought it was wonderful. She blushed when his blue eye caught her brown one in the mirror and didn’t pull away when his hand slipped down to cup her bottom with a sly grin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter that Angela had found reasons to be around the dressing rooms more and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You again?” he’d smile. And she’d blush, and he’d find some reason to touch her cheek or hold her waist, or whisper something in her ear. He’d slip her tiny treats; a slice of cake, a filched biscuit, a sliver of chocolate whenever he thought no-one was looking. When she went to bed after each show her heart was singing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it was a shock to spin into the dressing room one evening and into the arms of a tall, strong, clear-skinned young woman instead of into Jacob’s flirtatious presence. Angela pulled herself up suddenly, embarrassed and cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Oh! Sorry - you’re not...where’s Jacob?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShock and disappointment made her blunt. Rude. She blushed, but didn’t retract the words, even as she saw the hurt register in the woman’s clear blue eyes. He’d gone, she shrugged, like all the others. But she’d softened when she saw the look on Angela’s face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Sweet on him were you kid?’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAngela nodded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“What was it about him you liked so much?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAngela shrugged. “He was funny. Made me laugh. Something about…” she stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Go on” said the new wardrobe mistress though a mouth full of pins, as she yanked the netting on Angela’s tutu up over her head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It’s stupid. Just something about how he looked at me. It was like I was the only girl in the world. But he probably looked at everyone like that.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woman emerged from underneath Angela’s skirts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hey I bet that’s not true. Chin up, you never know what’s around the corner.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAngela smiled, but wouldn’t look at her. Soon she was bundled off to wait in the wings with the other chorus girls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut that night, after the show Angela was astonished to be told that ‘her young man’ was waiting for her at stage door. And he was. New jacket, neatly trimmed moustache and those laughing blue eyes. He waited for her as she wiped off her make-up and hung up her costume, then held out an arm and they wandered off together into the night, spilling jokes and laughter into the air like they were confetti.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other girls watched her go enviously, wishing a night out for themselves, instead of lazing around the theatre or rooming house yet again.

            "html": "<p>The old woman had been the worst; her cold rubbery fingers and skin bunched and grey and wrinkled, like wizened fruit around her eyes. She had kept her wages stashed in an old sock and never spent them on anything, not even new shoes when her toes were sticking out of the old ones. Then had come that awful fat man with the sinus problems. Angela had had to bite her tongue whenever his thick fingers had chanced a caress on her skin as he moved to straighten her tutu or rearrange a flounce of tulle on her costume.</p>\n<p>The procession of wardrobe assistants had always been varied at the Grand, but since Angela had been there it had felt like a different one every week. As soon as she grew used to the rancid breath and clammy fingers of one, along came another with hairy palms or some kind of facial curiosity. They were never just normal people, Angela mused. But then, what normal person would want to work backstage at the Grand every night for pennies? They wouldn’t, she decided.</p>\n<p>Until Jacob had arrived. She and the other ballet girls had huddled, shivering into the dressing room to be pulled and squeezed and pinched into their costumes and there he’d been, all smiles and winks. He was young, just a few years older than Angela, and eager to prove himself. The thin strip of dark brown hair dusting his upper lip showed that. Angela thought it was wonderful. She blushed when his blue eye caught her brown one in the mirror and didn’t pull away when his hand slipped down to cup her bottom with a sly grin.</p>\n<p>After that Angela had found reasons to be around the dressing rooms more and more.</p>\n<p>“You again?” he’d smile. And she’d blush, and he’d find some reason to touch her cheek or hold her waist, or whisper something in her ear. He’d slip her tiny treats; a slice of cake, a filched biscuit, a sliver of chocolate whenever he thought no-one was looking. When she went to bed after each show her heart was singing.</p>\n<p>So it was a shock to spin into the dressing room one evening and into the arms of a tall, strong, clear-skinned young woman instead of into Jacob’s flirtatious presence. Angela pulled herself up suddenly, embarrassed and cold.</p>\n<p>“Oh! Sorry - you’re not...where’s Jacob?”</p>\n<p>Shock and disappointment made her blunt. Rude. She blushed, but didn’t retract the words, even as she saw the hurt register in the woman’s clear blue eyes. He’d gone, she shrugged, like all the others. But she’d softened when she saw the look on Angela’s face.</p>\n<p>‘Sweet on him were you kid?’</p>\n<p>Angela nodded</p>\n<p>“What was it about him you liked so much?”</p>\n<p>Angela shrugged. “He was funny. Made me laugh. Something about…” she stopped.</p>\n<p>“Go on” said the new wardrobe mistress though a mouth full of pins, as she yanked the netting on Angela’s tutu up over her head.</p>\n<p>“It’s stupid. Just something about how he looked at me. It was like I was the only girl in the world. But he probably looked at everyone like that.”</p>\n<p>The woman emerged from underneath Angela’s skirts.</p>\n<p>“Hey I bet that’s not true. Chin up, you never know what’s around the corner.”</p>\n<p>Angela smiled, but wouldn’t look at her. Soon she was bundled off to wait in the wings with the other chorus girls.</p>\n<p>But that night, after the show Angela was astonished to be told that ‘her young man’ was waiting for her at stage door. And he was. New jacket, neatly trimmed moustache and those laughing blue eyes. He waited for her as she wiped off her make-up and hung up her costume, then held out an arm and they wandered off together into the night, spilling jokes and laughter into the air like they were confetti.</p>\n<p>The other girls watched her go enviously, wishing a night out for themselves, instead of lazing around the theatre or rooming house yet again. As a body they languidly wandered back to the dressing rooms.</p>\n<p>As they passed the door to the costume room the bravest girl stopped and gave the it a little push. It was unlocked. This was unheard of. Delighted, the girls poured inside to touch and caress the costumes that hung in shimmering rows in the shabby room. </p>\n<p>“That new wardrobe mistress isn’t going to be popular when they find out we were all able to get in here and paw these dresses” said Olivia, though she didn’t stop herself lifting the lead’s long green gown from its hanger and admiring it draped over herself in the mirror.</p>\n<p>“Here, give me a hand” she instructed one of the littler girls as she shrugged off her own clothes and stepped into the costume.

It was as if the outside didn’t exist. On the plate her toast dribbled its butter lasciviously into opulent puddles and she took a big bite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It’s horrible out there. Good job we’re tucked up safe in here,” she said with her mouth full, looking over at him. She was glad he was there, settled familiarly in his chair as usual, glad that he’d stayed after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMike and Emily had had their problems. For a little while she’d thought that they might not make it. She had worked so hard to scrape together this tiny little paradise for the two of them. It wasn’t much - a small house in the rough part of town and right on the railway tracks, so sleep wasn’t always easy. The noise of it could be enough to drown out a scream, let alone quiet conversation, Emily had thought once, but at least it covered up Mike’s snoring! Living together had taken some adjustments and some sacrifices. But, she thought, at least they had each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mike had told her that he wanted to leave Emily hadn’t been able to take it in. She’d felt stunned that everything she’d built could so easily come crashing down - Mike was the other supporting pillar that held up their little world and she couldn’t let him go, she’d have to fight for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end he’d stuck around. It had been hard and there was a long way to go, she had realised; it was never going to be like it was. But Mike was here to stay, Emily knew. It was just a question of adapting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You’re not in work tomorrow are you?” she asked, still chewing her way through her toast. “I have to go in at nine again - we have that new girl starting,  but don’t worry, I’ll be home normal time. What will you want for tea? Oh, you haven’t touched your toast!” She pushed the congealing mass towards him. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMike did not take the toast. His silence echoed around the room, like the ghost of their relationship. His sightless eyes screamed blankly into the too-warm little room, his icy fingers frozen into rigid claws on the arms of his chair. Emily chattered happily on, though it had been weeks since Mike had been able to answer, or even hear anything she said. Another train rumbled past, loud enough to drown out a scream.",

It was going to be tight. \r\n\r\nShe screwed her eye to the gap between the doors. A look for fierce determination crossed the face of the plumber and he began to tear at his clothes. He stood there in his socks, this mass of pale hillocks crowning above a scrap of pink offal nestling in the spines of an upturned hedgehog. \r\n\r\nAs soon as he was back in the kitchen she scampered over and scooped up his clothes, just in the nick of time to dash into the dining room as the front door opened and in strode Valerie, ranting on her phone how she’d been stood up. It was nothing she hadn’t done to Marjorie dozens of times, and there was no more perfect revenge than sneak into the woman’s house and set up a naked surprise in the kitchen. \r\n\r\nMarjorie bit down on her lower lip as Valerie strode into the kitchen and stopped talking mid-rant. \r\n\r\nAnd this the icing on the cake – Marjorie had spent six months trying to track down the no-good plumber who ripped off her Mum only to have him pull up at the bloody lights next to her. \r\n\r\n",

She put up her arms above her head for a lazy stretch that pushed forward her chest and gave him a glimpse of the firm lines of her abdomen. </p>\n<p>The plumber’s stubbly chin was hanging open. </p>\n<p>Marjorie said, ‘I’ll be in the lounge. Just pop your clothes outside the kitchen door if you’re up for it.’</p>\n<p>Safe in the lounge she sighed deeply, followed by a quick watch check. It was going to be tight. </p>\n<p>She screwed her eye to the gap between the doors. A look for fierce determination crossed the face of the plumber and he began to tear at his clothes. He stood there in his socks, this mass of pale hillocks crowning above a scrap of pink offal nestling in the spines of an upturned hedgehog. </p>\n<p>As soon as he was back in the kitchen she scampered over and scooped up his clothes, just in the nick of time to dash into the dining room as the front door opened and in strode Valerie, ranting on her phone how she’d been stood up. It was nothing she hadn’t done to Marjorie dozens of times, and there was no more perfect revenge than sneak into the woman’s house and set up a naked surprise in the kitchen. </p>\n<p>Marjorie bit down on her lower lip as Valerie strode into the kitchen and stopped talking mid-rant. </p>\n<p>And this the icing on the cake – Marjorie had spent six months trying to track down the no-good plumber who ripped off her Mum only to have him pull up at the bloody lights next to her. </p>\n"

            "content": "Nudist dies while walking on bridge in South Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA 35 year old British man has been found dead underneath the Heundeul Dali Bridge in South Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday 15 December 2018, tourists walking along the Pungam Reservoir in Gwangju found the body of Mr Barry Epworth, lying under the bridge which is a well-known local beauty spot for nudists.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDave Offal, a 51 year old butcher from Peebles said, “I just couldn’t believe it. Me and the wife have been coming here regularly for 6 years now and we’ve not come across anything like this before.”  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Offal added, “back home people think we’re a pair of freaks, but out here they can’t get enough of us.  It’s like we’re a tourist attraction in our own right!  We feel like celebrities.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr and Mrs Offal found the body of Barry Epworth, a 35 year old father of 9 from Scunthorpe, lying at the edge of the water.  “We saw something which looked a bit strange and we thought it was a dead badger.  On closer examination, we realised it wasn’t a badger, but a man covered in hedgehog excrement.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Epworth from Crowle in Scunthorpe was holidaying with his wife, Janice, when the untimely incident occurred.  Mrs Epworth said her husband got up very early the morning before and walked to the bridge alone.  When he returned, he said that after witnessing the numerous nudists and bystanders it attracted, he had never seen anything like it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“He was drawn to the place,” Janice said.  “I’ve been a nudist for years but Barry was a bit of a prude really.  I tried to get him to strip off loads of times at home and just let it all hang out, but he just wouldn’t have any of it.”  Mrs Epworth added, “it was starting to drive a massive wedge between us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Mr Epworth returned from his morning walk at Heundeul Dali Bridge (translated as The Wobbly Bridge) he was enthusiastic and told his wife they would return before the end of their two week trip and he would strip off and feel proud as he walked alongside the other nudists.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The funny side of this is, we weren’t even supposed to come here.  I’d booked to stay in Dong-Gu, which is just outside the town but the hotel was fully booked and we were sent here at the last minute.  Mrs Epworth smiled as she recalled her husband saying it was serendipity which had brought them there, adding “I am really sad that I never got to walk along the bridge with him.” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice have released a statement saying, “tourists and new people to the area are unaware of the potential dangers of walking across the wobbly bridge.  Our advice is to remain vigilant, and where possible, try to avoid walking across that particular bridge.  However, if it is unavoidable and you have to walk across, under no circumstances do it alone.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThey have asked for anyone who may have seen Mr Epworth with any hedgehogs, to please come forward.

Cloves, and flecks of orange peel floated in the cloudy surface and we stared together into the amber brilliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTiny miracles seemed to be taking place all around us. A turbaned man with night-dark skin blew fire from his bearded lips; exotic-eyed women juggled knives, bare-footed and barely clothed; an enormous jewelled elephant strode casually past, sweeping the air this way and that with her enormous trunk. These days you’d never see an elephant at the circus, but to us, back then, it was like magic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI remember that we shared a sticky pink cloud of candyfloss, I remember that we laughed as some of it stuck in his eyebrows and I remember the electric feeling when our fingers finally entwined, dissolving the coating of sugar and uncertainty.

It was full of people, children running excitedly, chattering families and blushing couples, like us, holding hands. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe show was breathtaking.

I hadn’t once felt it, though the night had been icy cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI struggle to remember so many of the details now. It was all such a long time ago and he’s not with me, anymore, to remind me. To nudge me in the street, or interrupt a movie, or to squeeze my hand in bed and ask me excitedly if I remember the way the sea looked that time we went to Greece or if I could still recall the time it rained so much we stayed inside for three days straight, eating tinned pineapple and drinking tea. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I’ll always remember the taste of those cider and candyfloss kisses that night, at the circus.

The lions roared, the clowns fell, the ringmaster bellowed, the cider fogged the edges of everything and it all seemed like a living dream of glittering lights and sawdust and colour. </p>\n<p>When we left the night wrapped itself around us like a cloak and he walked me home, my head full of everything I had seen and tasted and heard. </p>\n<p>When I finally got inside, dizzy with the sugar and cider I remember how I leaned against my front door, silently, so as not to wake my parents. It was only then that I realised that my shoes and socks were drenched from the walk through the fields. I hadn’t once felt it, though the night had been icy cold.</p>\n<p>I struggle to remember so many of the details now. It was all such a long time ago and he’s not with me, anymore, to remind me. To nudge me in the street, or interrupt a movie, or to squeeze my hand in bed and ask me excitedly if I remember the way the sea looked that time we went to Greece or if I could still recall the time it rained so much we stayed inside for three days straight, eating tinned pineapple and drinking tea. </p>\n<p>But I’ll always remember the taste of those cider and candyfloss kisses that night, at the circus. </p>\n"

            "content": "Jake woke up feeling sick. His bed felt as if it was swaying beneath him and the memories of getting home were hazy at best. He pulled the duvet up to cover his face and realised there was no duvet, his bed really was rolling from side to side and he lay on the wooden deck of an old fishing boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sat up and vomited. A large dog bounded over and licked it up, ravenously, which made him want to empty his guts all over again, but stopped himself for fear of perpetuating a vicious cycle. Behind him he could hear laughter and was pretty sure it was at him. He looked down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill in last night’s clothes, stained with grime and soaked. All around him was the overpowering stench of fish guts and rubber. What the fuck? Where were Alex and Sam?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSitting up jaggedly he looked around for the source of the laughter and found three old men behind him, gap-toothed and filthy, swathed in yellow rubber and blue wool. They were smoking and staring at him, amused. It was bracingly cold and his shirt was a thin one. All around was ice-blue air and grey sea. Not even a seagull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stood up, staggered and righted himself and tried to stand still. The boat was small and moving fast, so standing wasn’t easy, even without the jaegerbombs flashing scarlet behind his eyes. One of the old men threw the end of his cigarette into the sea and strode towards him. Jake tried to smile and said hello. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man said something in what sounded like Russian. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Where am I, please?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Raucous laughter*. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJake looked around for a sign of land, but there was nothing. The man was holding out a bundle of clothes to him and grinning. Jake took them and drew them on, smiling back, but there was something malevolent in the man’s eyes, and Jake didn’t think this was an act of kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clothes were old and they stank, but they were warm and Jake pulled them on gratefully, stamped his feet, and hoped they’d offer him a cigarette. Suddenly something squirmed in the pocket of his overalls. Jake panicked and threw it onto the floor to the echo of raucous laughter. It was a lobster. It scuttled quickly away and took shelter behind some coiled rope. Jake shuddered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men were looking serious now. One of them strode forward with some netting and a length of rope and gestured roughly towards the other men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Go - get to work.” His English heavily accented. Jake spluttered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Wait - what? I just need to get home!” He was afraid now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Home?! No. We pay for you. Your ‘friends’ take the cash. Now? you work for me. Go.” \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Jake hesitated the man raised his arm and struck him across the face. It was useless to struggle. Like the lobster Jake scuttled from sight and began the first hopeless task of his new life at sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

No sign of his clothes, nor his wallet or shoes, but as Tim said, at least she left the keys.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt's not how Friday night was supposed to go. Four guys, few drinks, nice meal, and then home by midnight. The first two worked out for me, Tim and Jeremy, only Pete didn't get the message. What he got was forty drinks, not all for him, at least half went on the girl and her friends. They were half smashed before they even met Pete, so I guess that’s why she was fine with it being nine o’clock on the edge of the dance floor and Pete, total stranger, with his fingers where they really should not have been in polite company.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI wasn’t going to give him the keys to the car, not again. Only when he came over he put both hands around Tim’s face and kissed him on the forehead.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTim’s idea was that we leave him in the street. Maybe a naked night on the tiles will shock him into acting like a normal person. The problem with that – Pete’s mother. There’s only one thing she loves more than her Samurai sword collection, and that’s her sweet baby Pete. We couldn’t even drive him home and come back, at forty five minutes each way our swanky restaurant table was a gonna.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nSo that was us, Friday night over, driving home to soggy fish and chips and warm lager from the offy. All of us talking big, how it’s the last time Pete comes out with us, how we’re going to tell him how rank we find his behaviour, but all of us knowing that come next month it’ll be the same thing over again.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI didn’t think the night could dive any lower, and then Tim started shrieking in horror. I was looking in the mirror, I was looking at Pete’s still sleeping, yet strangely happy face, Tim was shouting about walking, and that's how I hit the badger.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNot a killing blow, as it turns out, but at the time that poor badger sure looked a gonna, lying there all floppy on the side of the road. Lying there right under the sign for the boating lake. The boating lake we went to as kids, the one with the gate at the front where you pay to get in, and it looks like it has fences all round, only the wood’s all rotted where they let the hedges grow too close.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFriday night was saved! Me, Tim, and Jeremy, three young guys yet we sat around that table like three old men, saying how nice it was to not have to shout to be heard. How it was Pete the one who'd need to bellow to be heard, out there in the middle of that lake, naked in a boat with a badger.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd like I said, we all thought that badger was a gonna. \r\n\r\n",

My audience was waiting!</p>    <p>Well they’d have to wait a while longer. Before us was the male impersonator Stephen/Stephania in her trousers, moustache and false eyelashes, then the idiot playing songs on his musical saw; a trapeze act, (all sparkles and cheap thrills), the acrobatic dwarf troup and then us.</p>    <p>There we were on the bill - the headline act: Sybil &amp; Sam! People were beginning to give us the recognition we deserved. We were on the cusp of something huge, I could feel it.</p>    <p>Well, the recognition I deserved. She hardly earned her keep. It was me who did all the work; writing the gags, hours of practising, honing, refining to make ours the perfect comedy double act. </p>    <p>I had to hand it to us, we were funny; a little slapstick, a little bawdiness - just enough to titillate. I lived for that moment when we stood, bathed in the glow of the footlights, savouring the smell of greasepaint and burnt hair, dust and sweat and exhilaration. The smell of the theatre!</p>    <p>I looked into the darkness of the wings and caught her eye. She was flashing that insolent smile, mocking my shabby stage costume while she sat resplendent in her sparkling evening gown. I reminded myself that was why we were funny. I had written us like that! But her mockery hit home.</p>    <p>“I know what you’re doing” I hissed “and it won’t work. You can’t put me off. Tonight is my night.”</p>    <p>She was planning to upstage me. I knew it - to go off-script and throw me off balance. But we still had a little time.</p>    <p>“Come with me. Now. We need to talk.” </p>    <p>We went into an empty dressing room and I wheeled to face her.</p>    <p>“Why do you want to spoil this? You think you could do this without me?”</p>    <p>Always that niggling fear. Would she use my hard work to get to the top and then leave me with nothing? Did I need her more than... no! </p>    <p>“Who do you think you are? If it wasn’t for my writing, my performance you’d still be on your knees behind that public toilet where I found you. You were nothing before me.”</p>    <p>She said nothing, just tipped that crimson cat smile at me.</p>    <p>Too much. I lashed out, striking her hard, knocking her to the floor. And then I was kicking, punching, tearing. Screaming at the witch I had rescued and who was now plotting my undoing.</p>    <p>And then there were hands on me, pulling me from the spilled sawdust and rags. I saw what I had done. Her perfect porcelain face, smashed, a gaping hole in one white cheek; one eye gone, the other staring sightlessly ahead. Stuffing spilled from rents in her stomach; one arm stretched hopelessly forward.</p>    <p>The other performers stared. I had their attention now, alright. I dusted down my jacket and executed a perfect bow. One dwarf threw the tribute of a single, wilting rose at me, which flew to land on poor, broken Sibyl, our act in tatters on the dressing room floor.</p>" };
