<p>In an Irish accent the cheeky round face said, 'Top o' the morning to you.' He winked at Jeffers, then surged from the rear of the bus into a dive that became a forward roll that turned into a three foot dwarf standing on the tarmac.</p>
<p>The dwarf spread his arms wide, gave a weak 'Tada,' and then he was running.</p>
<p>A torrent of dwarves poured from the rear of the bus. Jeffers made a grab, and for a half second in his hands was a squirming bitey dwarf that kicked loose, rolled, sat up, spat his way, and then was scrambling for freedom.</p>
<p>Lewis poked his head from the rear of the bus, mouthful of his bratwurst hoagie showing behind gaping lips. The dwarves were a scattering cloud of pumping arms and legs.</p>
<p>Jeffers had to wave his arms. 'Christ, after them.'</p>
<p>Lewis and the uniformed cops took off <em>back</em> down the inside of the bus heading for the door at the front.</p>
<p>Jeffers muttered it - 'Christ, Landlubbers.'</p>
<p>He was done with Kentucky and its heat and its sour mash head splitting whisky. Back with the coast guard is what he needed - Columbians with their yachts and machine guns, take that any of the week over these morons that rode buses across county lines to some bent doctor who'd write them a script for twenty bucks a pop.</p>
<p>The driver of this Oxybus had this this dumb look on his face, Joey Pimento watching cops crab walking, squatting low as they tried to corral dwarves. A little further down the street the first dwarf was hopping table to table in front of a steak house, a uniformed cop keeping pace with him from the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Two minutes previous Pimento had been cocky, full of grins that he was the sole occupant of this otherwise completely empty schoolbus.</p>
<p>Jeffers said, 'Not something you see everyday.'</p>
<p>Something dinked against his left foot. A bottle of pills still rolling gently side to side. The label on it said Oxycontin.</p>
<p>A big smile came to his face.</p>
<p>Jeffers said, 'One hundred percent pure, uncut, Hillbilly heroin.'</p>
<p>He grinned at Pimento.</p>
<p>'Let me guess - you did a head count at the start, then you made sure your pill count matched the head count?'</p>
<p>Weakly, Pimento said, 'No comment.'</p>
<p>Jeffers said, 'What is for you? Two strikes already? Man, we catch you writing in a library book that's five years, minimum. But driving an Oxybus across county lines?' He whistled softly. 'Twenty years, maybe? No parole.'</p>
<p>A shake of the head, then Pimento said, 'Taking it to the bus-wash, no idea who they are. Must've snuck inside some place.'</p>
<p>Jeffers said, 'Name of the doctor that wrote the prescriptions? Name of your boss? Come on man, work with me.'</p>
<p>Silence from Pimento.</p>
<p>Jeffers grinned, a thought coming to him.</p>
<p>He said, 'Think they'll call you Snow White in Jacksonville? Or is that what they'll call your peachy white ass?'</p>
