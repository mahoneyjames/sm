<p>Each of them as male but to look at them is to lust for female beauty seldom seen since the rise of the Citadel. In a world without women the price of a woman's touch is whatever a Bellini Boy whispers.</p>
<p>Too rich for your blood, then instead find a heifer in their drag sat behind a tall Pina Colada. We're just as shaved and plucked and primped as any Bellini Boy only there's no escaping the line of the jaw, or the line of the dress.</p>
<p>Does it matter in the dark?</p>
<p>Doing my best to hide in the shadow but yet another hopeful face presents itself.</p>
<p>Tells me he can get me a new Library book. Whatever subject I want.</p>
<p>He means he can steal a book. A stolen book means no fines to pay the Citadael, least for them does the stealing. It means knowledge, an escape from this life of Pina Coladas and a pillow in the grass every night.</p>
<p>He says I have nice eyes. Girl's eyes.</p>
<p>His own twinkle inside a tanned face from a life outdoor but not burnt red to farmer's glow.</p>
<p>But he's not the Brewhead I'm looking for.</p>
<p>The one I want spits on Ladyboys even as he craves them. The Brewhead I seek drinks in the shadows, and he follows me as I cross the rubble strip and reach the grass with its pockets of sand home to squirming couples. I let him close, then take a turn for the worse, into this place of alleys and tunnels choked with the wild grass to almost above my head. Into this place of no exits.</p>
<p>He is a silhouette that creeps closer.</p>
<p>I tell him, wait, and slowly turn, gathering up the coarse strands of horse hair wig from the back of my neck. It's a single catch holds the dress. Nothing underneath but real curves.</p>
<p>He doesn't know what to do when I take his knife hand and press it to my belly, this strip of ice against naked skin.</p>
<p>I ask him, want to be a real man?</p>
<p>His knife finds the grass as he scrabbles at the catch of his belt.</p>
<p>I had this plan, my own knife to his neck, ask him did he slit the throat of a Bellini boy when he was done?</p>
<p>Was it you killed my brother?</p>
<p>What rises instead is my rage, and the rapier. Does he see the point of his devil as it pricks for his right eye?</p>
<p>I am a girl, and escape to the Citadel is mine for a smile, the bride price of my freedom a new home for my father, one without holes in the roof or Brewheads kicking the door.</p>
<p>But not today. Not till I find the man gave my brother his own escape. Not till I give it back to him.</p>
